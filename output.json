However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals' actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries' formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management's efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model.

When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers' income.

This study systematically documents current social science understanding of the multiple human dimensions that should be incorporated within ecosystem assessments and the overall approach to each of these within IEAs and other EBFM efforts. These dimensions include the multi-faceted nature of human well-being, heterogeneity in human well-being derived from fisheries, adaptive behaviors, and cumulative effects. The systematic inclusion of these dimensions into IEAs is then laid out in a conceptual framework that details how a perturbation reverberates through a fisheries system and the iterative approach that should be undertaken to understand its impacts on human dimensions. This framework is supplemented with a data collection scheme that is intended to facilitate operationalization. The detailed examination of incorporating human dimensions within IEAs presented in this study should further resonate with other ecosystem assessment efforts, providing not just ample evidence of the need for moving beyond simplistic assumptions of human homogeneity but a means of systematically integrating a more realistic and representative perspective.

Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change.

Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change.

However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing “flow”,“addition”, and “deletion” effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments:(1) megafauna conservation,(2) alternative livelihood programs,(3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives.

Understanding these linkages, by considering multiple ecosystem services simultaneously supports management of the environment and sustainable use of resources. The UK marine environment is relatively data rich, yet the links between ecosystem and several ecosystem services and linkages between services are poorly described. A workshop with 35 marine scientists was used to create a conceptual model that links ecosystem components and key processes to four services they provide and to highlight trade-offs between them.

These linkages can affect trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Understanding these linkages, by considering multiple ecosystem services simultaneously supports management of the environment and sustainable use of resources. The UK marine environment is relatively data rich, yet the links between ecosystem and several ecosystem services and linkages between services are poorly described. A workshop with 35 marine scientists was used to create a conceptual model that links ecosystem components and key processes to four services they provide and to highlight trade-offs between them. The model was subsequently further developed to include pressures and mitigating management measures. The models are discussed in terms of their application to marine data to facilitate evidence-based marine management and their usefulness to communicate management measures with managers and stakeholders.

Burrowing seabirds, as prevalent vertebrate consumers, have the potential to impact consumptive effects via adding marine nutrients to soil (i.e. resource subsidies) and non-consumptive effects via soil disturbance associated with excavating burrows (i.e. ecosystem engineering). However, the exact mechanisms by which they influence invertebrates are poorly understood. We examined how soil chemistry and plant and invertebrate communities changed across a gradient of seabird burrow density on two islands in northern New Zealand. Increasing seabird burrow density was associated with increased soil nutrient availability and changes in plant community structure and the abundance of nearly all the measured invertebrate groups. Increasing seabird densities had a negative effect on invertebrates that were strongly influenced by soil-surface litter, a positive effect on fungal-feeding invertebrates, and variable effects on invertebrate groups with diverse feeding strategies. Gastropoda and Araneae species richness and composition were also influenced by seabird activity. Generalized multilevel path analysis revealed that invertebrate responses were strongly driven by seabird engineering effects, via increased soil disturbance, reduced soil-surface litter, and changes in trophic interactions. Almost no significant effects of resource subsidies were detected.

Burrowing seabirds, as prevalent vertebrate consumers, have the potential to impact consumptive effects via adding marine nutrients to soil (i.e. resource subsidies) and non-consumptive effects via soil disturbance associated with excavating burrows (i.e. ecosystem engineering). However, the exact mechanisms by which they influence invertebrates are poorly understood. We examined how soil chemistry and plant and invertebrate communities changed across a gradient of seabird burrow density on two islands in northern New Zealand. Increasing seabird burrow density was associated with increased soil nutrient availability and changes in plant community structure and the abundance of nearly all the measured invertebrate groups. Increasing seabird densities had a negative effect on invertebrates that were strongly influenced by soil-surface litter, a positive effect on fungal-feeding invertebrates, and variable effects on invertebrate groups with diverse feeding strategies. Gastropoda and Araneae species richness and composition were also influenced by seabird activity. Generalized multilevel path analysis revealed that invertebrate responses were strongly driven by seabird engineering effects, via increased soil disturbance, reduced soil-surface litter, and changes in trophic interactions. Almost no significant effects of resource subsidies were detected.

Reducing over-intensive sea use activities and alleviating ecological pressures by adjusting functional zones with greater economic stimulation to low-pressure areas are suggested.

However, there is no specific set of indicators for measuring the maritime logistics performance (MLP) as the popular indexes such as the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) or the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) are either too broad to capture the specific performance of maritime logistics, or too narrow to incorporate all the functional areas of MLP. This article addresses this gap and proposes a comprehensive performance measurement model for maritime logistics. The study attributes extensive literature review and experts’ opinions for developing the initial list of indicators. For extracting and validating the principal factors, the study adopts exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and has found nineteen indicators of the MLP. Based on the Eigenvalues, the indicators have been clustered under four principal factors namely- Port Performance, Shipping Connectivity, Hinterland Logistics, and Sustainability and Resilience.

However, there is no specific set of indicators for measuring the maritime logistics performance (MLP) as the popular indexes such as the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) or the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) are either too broad to capture the specific performance of maritime logistics, or too narrow to incorporate all the functional areas of MLP. This article addresses this gap and proposes a comprehensive performance measurement model for maritime logistics. The study attributes extensive literature review and experts’ opinions for developing the initial list of indicators. For extracting and validating the principal factors, the study adopts exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and has found nineteen indicators of the MLP. Based on the Eigenvalues, the indicators have been clustered under four principal factors namely- Port Performance, Shipping Connectivity, Hinterland Logistics, and Sustainability and Resilience.

The main objective of this paper is to explore a more holistic approach to modelling options for the difficult task of managing an open access fishery. To this end, a system dynamics model was used to provide a general framework that incorporates several interacting factors that influence the management of the fishery. Such a model, which combines both biological and economic data, is appropriate for fisheries management practise. In this case, three policy scenarios (in addition to a business-as-usual scenario) based on a reduction in the number of boats fishing are used to simulate the behaviour of the stock IM. The results show that the optimal CPUE level is achieved with a 25% reduction in the total number of boats.

Identifying the links to the benefits accrued to society from ecological restoration is of significant importance for achieving successful conservation outcomes and guiding financial investments in ecological restoration. This paper aims to analyze the action mechanism of marine ecological restoration on ecological, economic and social benefits in China. The research hypothesis of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration was first proposed from a theoretical research perspective. On this basis, a structural equation model was employed to validate theoretical assumptions and quantitatively analyze the mechanism of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration in China. We find that marine ecological restoration can improve the level of marine ecosystem services and have a significant positive impact on promoting economic and social development.

Identifying the links to the benefits accrued to society from ecological restoration is of significant importance for achieving successful conservation outcomes and guiding financial investments in ecological restoration. This paper aims to analyze the action mechanism of marine ecological restoration on ecological, economic and social benefits in China. The research hypothesis of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration was first proposed from a theoretical research perspective. On this basis, a structural equation model was employed to validate theoretical assumptions and quantitatively analyze the mechanism of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration in China. We find that marine ecological restoration can improve the level of marine ecosystem services and have a significant positive impact on promoting economic and social development.

The rate and magnitude of ecological transformations induced by climate change, habitat destruction, overexploitation and pollution are now so substantial that a sixth mass extinction event is currently underway. The biodiversity crisis of the Anthropocene urges scientists to put forward a transformative vision to promote the conservation of biodiversity, and thus indirectly the preservation of ecosystem functions. Here, we identify pressing issues in global change biology research and propose an integrative framework based on multilayer biological networks as a tool to support conservation actions and marine risk assessments in multi-stressor scenarios. Multilayer networks can integrate different levels of environmental and biotic complexity, enabling us to combine information on molecular, physiological and behaviour responses, species interactions and biotic communities. The ultimate aim of this framework is to link human-induced environmental changes to species physiology, fitness, biogeography and ecosystem impacts across vast seascapes and time frames, to help guide solutions to address biodiversity loss and ecological tipping points. Further, we also define our current ability to adopt a widespread use of multilayer networks within ecology, evolution and conservation by providing examples of case-studies. We also assess which approaches are ready to be transferred and which ones require further development before use. We conclude that multilayer biological networks will be crucial to inform (using reliable multi-levels integrative indicators) stakeholders and support their decision-making concerning the sustainable use of resources and marine conservation.

The biodiversity crisis of the Anthropocene urges scientists to put forward a transformative vision to promote the conservation of biodiversity, and thus indirectly the preservation of ecosystem functions. Here, we identify pressing issues in global change biology research and propose an integrative framework based on multilayer biological networks as a tool to support conservation actions and marine risk assessments in multi-stressor scenarios. Multilayer networks can integrate different levels of environmental and biotic complexity, enabling us to combine information on molecular, physiological and behaviour responses, species interactions and biotic communities. The ultimate aim of this framework is to link human-induced environmental changes to species physiology, fitness, biogeography and ecosystem impacts across vast seascapes and time frames, to help guide solutions to address biodiversity loss and ecological tipping points. Further, we also define our current ability to adopt a widespread use of multilayer networks within ecology, evolution and conservation by providing examples of case-studies. We also assess which approaches are ready to be transferred and which ones require further development before use. We conclude that multilayer biological networks will be crucial to inform (using reliable multi-levels integrative indicators) stakeholders and support their decision-making concerning the sustainable use of resources and marine conservation.

Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most deployed technologies, due to its electrical energy efficiency and comparatively low costs. However, the required energy for desalination processes is often still converted from fossil sources. Given the growing demand for seawater desalination and the energy sector’s parallel decarbonization, the substitution by renewable energy sources (RES) is a critical issue. The volatility, lower availability of renewable energy, and cost for required electrical energy storage (EES) are all obstacles to the decarbonization of large-scale desalination plants and may affect production volume and water production costs negatively.\nThis paper presents a mathematical model to determine a cost-optimal energy conversion and EES mix for the design and operation of large-scale seawater RO desalination plants. The linear program ensures satisfaction of the plant’s energetic demands. Furthermore, the model allows to investigate the general feasibility of integrating RES into large-scale desalination processes, which are examined by means of a case study while employing location-specific weather data. Different types of energy conversion technologies and the effect of EES on operating behavior, greenhouse gas emissions, and water unit costs are investigated. Specifically, the indirect storage of electrical energy via the smart management of a desalination plant’s oversized RO membranes is examined and compared to battery energy storage (BES).\nResults indicate that RES cannot meet an RO desalination plant’s full and constant electrical load demand without a high BES capacity, which is probably not feasible from a technical and economic point of view. The economic penalty from energy storage costs on one unit of desalinated water ranges from 3.10 $/m3 up to 5.38 $/m3. However, operating an oversized RO desalination plant intermittently could reduce the energy-related costs substantially and potentially provide a more appropriate way of adapting to a volatile supply of energy from renewable sources in order to decarbonize the desalination processes. Specific emissions of desalinated water can be reduced from 1.5 kg CO2 eq./m3 when relying mostly on combined cycle gas turbines down to 0.124 kg CO2 eq./m3 by intermittent operation and fully relying on renewable energy sources.

Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most deployed technologies, due to its electrical energy efficiency and comparatively low costs. However, the required energy for desalination processes is often still converted from fossil sources. Given the growing demand for seawater desalination and the energy sector’s parallel decarbonization, the substitution by renewable energy sources (RES) is a critical issue. The volatility, lower availability of renewable energy, and cost for required electrical energy storage (EES) are all obstacles to the decarbonization of large-scale desalination plants and may affect production volume and water production costs negatively.\nThis paper presents a mathematical model to determine a cost-optimal energy conversion and EES mix for the design and operation of large-scale seawater RO desalination plants. The linear program ensures satisfaction of the plant’s energetic demands. Furthermore, the model allows to investigate the general feasibility of integrating RES into large-scale desalination processes, which are examined by means of a case study while employing location-specific weather data. Different types of energy conversion technologies and the effect of EES on operating behavior, greenhouse gas emissions, and water unit costs are investigated. Specifically, the indirect storage of electrical energy via the smart management of a desalination plant’s oversized RO membranes is examined and compared to battery energy storage (BES).\nResults indicate that RES cannot meet an RO desalination plant’s full and constant electrical load demand without a high BES capacity, which is probably not feasible from a technical and economic point of view. The economic penalty from energy storage costs on one unit of desalinated water ranges from 3.10 $/m3 up to 5.38 $/m3. However, operating an oversized RO desalination plant intermittently could reduce the energy-related costs substantially and potentially provide a more appropriate way of adapting to a volatile supply of energy from renewable sources in order to decarbonize the desalination processes. Specific emissions of desalinated water can be reduced from 1.5 kg CO2 eq./m3 when relying mostly on combined cycle gas turbines down to 0.124 kg CO2 eq./m3 by intermittent operation and fully relying on renewable energy sources.

Prior studies primarily focused on reducing risk through reinforcement of supply-side reliability. However, during or after a disaster, electricity demand is likely to vary (e.g., electricity use may increase for disaster relief supply production or decrease because of governmental energy conservation policies). This study examined the impact of demand-side responses from industrial, commercial, and residential sectors on the performance of the power grid when supply shortages occur after earthquakes. Electricity supply and demand in the context of seismic hazards were modeled based on the system dynamics approach, and the model was tested with seismic hazards that occurred in South Korea in 2016.

To address this gap, we developed a system dynamic model to represent the dynamics between human societies, decision-making processes, adaptation measures, and hydrological extremes.

Our findings show that the presence of a prevalent social group with a certain risk attitude has a strong influence on the awareness, preparedness, and consequent losses of the other social groups. On the other hand, the homogenous presence of social groups with diverse risk attitudes leads to higher drought and flood losses due to the unsustainable water use of risk-neglecting and risk-downplaying groups.

Predictors for distinct types of knowledge were different and provide insights that could help target specific ocean literacy gaps. The study also finds that commercial marine stakeholders were more knowledgeable than other coastal residents. Having an economic stake in the marine environment appears to be a strong motivation to be more educated about the ocean.

System dynamic modeling was conducted to analyze sustainable tuna industry development based on various points of view, to accommodate stakeholder interest. The success of tuna processing industry development, were assessed from the increase of production values, the preservation of tuna and tuna-like fish stock in the environment, and also the improvement of social welfare. Simulations were carried out for 25 years to predict the condition of fish stocks in the future, based on current policies applied. Simulation results show that to develop tuna processing industry while maintaining the stock of tuna in its sustainable conditions, only limiting the fish catch was not enough, the process of integrating industry, socioeconomic and policy made by related institutions were also important.

Since societies are constantly exposed to various natural disasters like earthquakes, many precautions must be taken both before and after a disaster to minimize the damage. Seismic resilience is one of the practical assessments that may be taken in this regard. Quantifying the functionality of seismic resilience requires a systematic examination of the relevant components and their functional impact. We present a framework based on fragility, consequence and recoverability stages for evaluating the impact of a component on its functionality for earthquake events. Within this study, we introduce a novel set of indicators, which are derived from the key variables impacted by earthquakes, including hospitals, grids, and infrastructures. To that end, we have developed a system dynamics (SD) model to assess earthquake resilience in the context of Society 5.0, considering three earthquake magnitudes (7, 8, and 9 Mw) to simulate societal seismic resilience. We also perform sensitivity analysis to validate the outcomes of the policy simulations. Our findings affirm that by scrutinizing the seismic resilience of critical infrastructure and proposing relevant policies, it is possible to minimize disaster-related damage.

Since societies are constantly exposed to various natural disasters like earthquakes, many precautions must be taken both before and after a disaster to minimize the damage. Seismic resilience is one of the practical assessments that may be taken in this regard. Quantifying the functionality of seismic resilience requires a systematic examination of the relevant components and their functional impact. We present a framework based on fragility, consequence and recoverability stages for evaluating the impact of a component on its functionality for earthquake events. Within this study, we introduce a novel set of indicators, which are derived from the key variables impacted by earthquakes, including hospitals, grids, and infrastructures. To that end, we have developed a system dynamics (SD) model to assess earthquake resilience in the context of Society 5.0, considering three earthquake magnitudes (7, 8, and 9 Mw) to simulate societal seismic resilience. We also perform sensitivity analysis to validate the outcomes of the policy simulations. Our findings affirm that by scrutinizing the seismic resilience of critical infrastructure and proposing relevant policies, it is possible to minimize disaster-related damage.

Although the protection reduces the area available for fishing, it has been argued that the spillover effect can increase resources in the adjoining areas. The purpose of this study is to calculate the value of the provision of fishing resources resulting from an increase in the system of marine protected areas in Colombia. To do that, a surplus-production based dynamic bio-economic model is developed for white shrimp (Litopenaeus occidentalis), a species important socially and economically in Colombia. The model includes a protected area with essential habitats, a nonprotected area, and mobility of species between them. Changes in biomass, catch, effort and the economic benefits of fishing through time, under different protection scenarios, are analyzed. Despite the reduction of the area available for fishing, in the mid-term, the protected areas generate increased levels of biomass and greater benefits associated to the fishing activity, because of the spillover effect. In that sense, the marine protected areas constitute a valid alternative for fishery conservation with the potential to generate economic benefits in the midterm.

Although the protection reduces the area available for fishing, it has been argued that the spillover effect can increase resources in the adjoining areas. The purpose of this study is to calculate the value of the provision of fishing resources resulting from an increase in the system of marine protected areas in Colombia. To do that, a surplus-production based dynamic bio-economic model is developed for white shrimp (Litopenaeus occidentalis), a species important socially and economically in Colombia. The model includes a protected area with essential habitats, a nonprotected area, and mobility of species between them. Changes in biomass, catch, effort and the economic benefits of fishing through time, under different protection scenarios, are analyzed. Despite the reduction of the area available for fishing, in the mid-term, the protected areas generate increased levels of biomass and greater benefits associated to the fishing activity, because of the spillover effect. In that sense, the marine protected areas constitute a valid alternative for fishery conservation with the potential to generate economic benefits in the midterm.

This study systematically documents current social science understanding of the multiple human dimensions that should be incorporated within ecosystem assessments and the overall approach to each of these within IEAs and other EBFM efforts. These dimensions include the multi-faceted nature of human well-being, heterogeneity in human well-being derived from fisheries, adaptive behaviors, and cumulative effects. The systematic inclusion of these dimensions into IEAs is then laid out in a conceptual framework that details how a perturbation reverberates through a fisheries system and the iterative approach that should be undertaken to understand its impacts on human dimensions. This framework is supplemented with a data collection scheme that is intended to facilitate operationalization. The detailed examination of incorporating human dimensions within IEAs presented in this study should further resonate with other ecosystem assessment efforts, providing not just ample evidence of the need for moving beyond simplistic assumptions of human homogeneity but a means of systematically integrating a more realistic and representative perspective.

However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals’ actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries’ formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management’s efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model. (2) Income inequality outcomes are associated with changes in cooperative trade relationships. When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers’ income. We observe an offset of this loss in income by including cooperative relationships between fish traders (oligopoly) in the model. These relationships break down following species distribution changes and result in an increase in prices fishers receive.

This study provides relevant information to control carbon emissions at the marine level, and predicts the development trend of carbon emissions from marine fisheries, which can provide a reference for fisheries to seek an effective path of energy conservation and emission reduction, and improve their high-quality development level.

Increased treatment could help alleviate water quality issues by constructing more treatment plants; however, in many areas there exist economic constraints. Energy recovery methods including the utilization of biogas and incineration of biosolids generated during the treatment process may help to alleviate treatment costs. This study explores the potential for investments in energy recovery from wastewater to increase treatment levels and thus improve surface water quality. This was done by examining the relationships between nutrient over-enrichment, wastewater treatment, and energy recovery at a global scale using system dynamics simulation as part of the ANEMI integrated assessment model. The results show that a significant amount of energy can be recovered from wastewater, which helps to alleviate some of the costs of treatment. It was found that wastewater treatment levels could be increased by 34%, helping to offset the higher nutrient loading from a growing population with access to improved sanitation. The production of renewable natural gas from biogas was found to have the potential to prolong the depletion of natural gas resources used to produce electricity and heat. It is recommended that agricultural nutrient discharges be better managed to help reduce nutrient over-enrichment on global scale.

Increased treatment could help alleviate water quality issues by constructing more treatment plants; however, in many areas there exist economic constraints. Energy recovery methods including the utilization of biogas and incineration of biosolids generated during the treatment process may help to alleviate treatment costs. This study explores the potential for investments in energy recovery from wastewater to increase treatment levels and thus improve surface water quality. This was done by examining the relationships between nutrient over-enrichment, wastewater treatment, and energy recovery at a global scale using system dynamics simulation as part of the ANEMI integrated assessment model. The results show that a significant amount of energy can be recovered from wastewater, which helps to alleviate some of the costs of treatment. It was found that wastewater treatment levels could be increased by 34%, helping to offset the higher nutrient loading from a growing population with access to improved sanitation. The production of renewable natural gas from biogas was found to have the potential to prolong the depletion of natural gas resources used to produce electricity and heat. It is recommended that agricultural nutrient discharges be better managed to help reduce nutrient over-enrichment on global scale.

First, the aquaculture management and main biochemical processes were parametrized according to the biological populations present, the physical environment, and the management practices for the integrated aquaculture marine pond of Portunus trituberculatus– Penaeus japonicus– Sinonovacula constricta. The ecosystem model of the pond unit was constructed by coupling the individual growth models of the three cultured animals. The goodness-of-fit indicators showed that this model accurately reproduced the dynamics of the cultured animals, plankton, and nutrients. After the ecosystem model was constructed and validated, the carrying capacity of the integrated aquaculture pond was evaluated by adjusting the stocking density and management practices based on the tailwater discharge standards. The economic benefits of the system and the ecological benefits of polyculture razor clams were quantitatively compared under two scenarios: the current stocking density and reaching the maximum capacity. The assessment results show that the aquaculture pond reached the carrying capacity when the stocking density was 1.8 times the current scenario (18 ind m−2, 27 ind m−2, 22 ind m−2 for P. trituberculatus, P. japonicus and S. constricta).

In this research, a Copula-based optimization method is proposed to solve the problems in bivariate design of urban stormwater and drainage systems resulting from ignorance of precipitation temporal dependence and discrepancy between different design codes. Optimized design combinations of stormwater and drainage systems conditioned on given Kendall bivariate return periods or return periods of either system can be obtained using the optimization method for the case study of Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Results show that the temporal dependencies between precipitation series with different durations should be carefully considered, which can be sufficiently described by Copula functions. Based on the optimized design combinations, it is found that the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Sponge City Plans are underestimated for both Zhongshan and Zhuhai, which restricts the full use of the drainage systems. According to the optimized results, the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Zhongshan (Zhuhai) should be adjusted to 8.04 a (6.76 a) for the downtown area and 6.52 a (5.59 a) for other areas, conditioned on the planned return periods for P24 h in Sponge City Plans. The proposed optimization method provides a useful approach for the bivariate design of stormwater and drainage systems.

In this research, a Copula-based optimization method is proposed to solve the problems in bivariate design of urban stormwater and drainage systems resulting from ignorance of precipitation temporal dependence and discrepancy between different design codes. Optimized design combinations of stormwater and drainage systems conditioned on given Kendall bivariate return periods or return periods of either system can be obtained using the optimization method for the case study of Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Results show that the temporal dependencies between precipitation series with different durations should be carefully considered, which can be sufficiently described by Copula functions. Based on the optimized design combinations, it is found that the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Sponge City Plans are underestimated for both Zhongshan and Zhuhai, which restricts the full use of the drainage systems. According to the optimized results, the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Zhongshan (Zhuhai) should be adjusted to 8.04 a (6.76 a) for the downtown area and 6.52 a (5.59 a) for other areas, conditioned on the planned return periods for P24 h in Sponge City Plans. The proposed optimization method provides a useful approach for the bivariate design of stormwater and drainage systems.

The methodology on how ship emissions impact air quality and human health are comparatively well established and used in cost-benefit analysis of policy proposals. However, the knowledge base is not the same for impacts on the marine environment and a coherent environmental and socio-economic impact assessment of shipping has not yet been made. This risk policies to be biased towards air pollution whilst trading off impacts on the marine environment. The aim of the current study was to develop a comprehensive framework on how different pressures from shipping degrade marine ecosystems, air quality and human welfare. A secondary aim was to quantify the societal damage costs of shipping due to the degradation of human welfare in a Baltic Sea case study. By adding knowledge from marine ecotoxicology and life-cycle analysis to the existing knowledge from climate, air pollution and environmental economics we were able to establish a more comprehensive conceptual framework that allows for valuation of environmental impacts from shipping, but it still omits economic values for biological pollution, littering and underwater noise. The results for the Baltic Sea case showed the total annual damage costs of Baltic Sea shipping to be 2.9 billion €2010 (95% CI 2.0–3.9 billion €2010). The damage costs due to impacts on marine eutrophication (768 million €2010) and marine ecotoxicity (582 million €2010) were in the same range as the total damage costs associated with reduced air quality (816 million €2010) and climate change (737 million €2010). The framework and the results from the current study can be used in future socio-economic assessments of ship emissions to prioritize cost efficient measures. The framework can be used globally but the damage costs presented on the marine environment are restricted to emissions on the Baltic Sea and Kattegat region as they are based on willingness to pay studies conducted on citizens around the Baltic Sea where eutrophication and emissions of chemicals are particularly threats to the state of the Baltic Sea.

The recent research on this contaminant threat is generally focused on surface waters (mainly oceans and rivers), while aquifer contamination is only marginally mentioned as an issue needing further investigation. Synthetic microfibers can be introduced into soils in different ways (e.g. wastewater treatment plants or greywater discharge, septic tank outflows, direct injection of contaminated water in cases of managed aquifer recharge, losing streams, etc.), and can thus reach aquifer systems due to leaching or infiltration in soil pores. Microfibers can then adsorb persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, which include persistent organic pollutants and metals, and become a carrier of harmful substances in the aquifer system, hence contributing to the overall contamination in both urban and rural areas. For this reason, it is of paramount importance, not only to assess the occurrence and fate of microplastic fibers in groundwater, but also to study the role of microplastics as carriers of contaminants within the aquifer and to advance standardization and organization of monitoring campaigns. Only by addressing these key challenges can hydrogeologists contribute to the state of the art on microplastic pollution and ensure that groundwater is not neglected in the environmental assessments tackling this contaminant of emerging concern.

The recent research on this contaminant threat is generally focused on surface waters (mainly oceans and rivers), while aquifer contamination is only marginally mentioned as an issue needing further investigation. Synthetic microfibers can be introduced into soils in different ways (e.g. wastewater treatment plants or greywater discharge, septic tank outflows, direct injection of contaminated water in cases of managed aquifer recharge, losing streams, etc.), and can thus reach aquifer systems due to leaching or infiltration in soil pores. Microfibers can then adsorb persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, which include persistent organic pollutants and metals, and become a carrier of harmful substances in the aquifer system, hence contributing to the overall contamination in both urban and rural areas. For this reason, it is of paramount importance, not only to assess the occurrence and fate of microplastic fibers in groundwater, but also to study the role of microplastics as carriers of contaminants within the aquifer and to advance standardization and organization of monitoring campaigns. Only by addressing these key challenges can hydrogeologists contribute to the state of the art on microplastic pollution and ensure that groundwater is not neglected in the environmental assessments tackling this contaminant of emerging concern.
