There are no pathways that are free of stress. However, many routes are possible. A good understanding of the dynamic behavior of systems is crucial, and proper support tools are needed to assess the outcomes of every selected pathway. This study aims to develop an Internet-based interface tool for the national energy simulation model as a tool for a “hybrid forum”; study energy transition lock-ins in one of the Eastern European countries; and apply the interface tool to study different pathways to Latvia’s climate and energy goals. System dynamics are used to reach the goals of the study. A causal loop diagram is applied to study feedback loops and lock-ins, a stock-and-flow structure is used to build a simulation model, and a user interface tool is built on top of it. The results show that the developed interface tool is user-friendly and can be used as a discussion platform. The results from the case study reveal how the soft power of Russia can lock in the energy transition in Eastern European countries by creating policy choices with additive effects and what pathways towards energy transition can be used to lock-out.

Doing so will better inform consumers and assist resource managers in matching fisheries and conservation policies with natural borders and pathways, including stock boundaries, networks of marine protected areas, and fisheries management areas. Such mapping necessitates an unprecedented synthesis of natural and social sciences, including knowledge of adult fish population abundance and movements, egg output, larval dispersal, and recruitment to juvenile and adult habitats, as well as fisheries stock assessment, capture, and distribution through human social networks. The challenge is to fully integrate oceanography, population genetics, ecology, and social sciences with fisheries biology to reveal the patterns and mechanisms of “Fish Flow” from spawning to supper. As practitioners representing all five of these disciplines, we believe that Fish Flow analyses will promote sustainable fisheries management and marine conservation efforts, and may foster public knowledge, wise seafood choices, and appreciation of social–ecological interconnections involving fisheries.

Despite having considerable global potential, wave energy has still not reached a state of maturity or economic competitiveness to have made an impact. Challenges include the high capital and operational costs associated with deployment in the harsh ocean environment, so it is imperative that the full energy harnessing capacity of wave energy devices, and arrays of devices in farms, is realised. To this end, control technology has an important role to play in maximising power capture, while ensuring that physical system constraints are respected, and control actions do not adversely affect device lifetime. Within the gamut of control technology, a variety of tools can be brought to bear on the wave energy control problem, including various control strategies (optimal, robust, nonlinear, etc.), data-based model identification, estimation, and forecasting. However, the wave energy problem displays a number of unique features which challenge the traditional application of these techniques, while also presenting a number of control ‘paradoxes’. This review articulates the important control-related characteristics of the wave energy control problem, provides a survey of currently applied control and control-related techniques, and gives some perspectives on the outstanding challenges and future possibilities. The emerging area of control co-design, which is especially relevant to the relatively immature area of wave energy system design, is also covered.

Ideally, enough information will be collected to enable management strategy evaluations on the stock, providing guidance on future management decisions. In many fisheries management agencies, however, the ability to rapidly and cost-effectively build and run models to evaluate management strategies is as much an impediment to their development as the lack of data.
The BIOMAS software provides users with the ability to rapidly develop single or multi-species, length-based population dynamics models for the exploration of alternative management strategies in a Bayesian-based framework. The system is theoretically capable of incorporating any number of species, fishing fleets and spatial compartments in a single model. Further complexity is provided with the ability to implement management and environmental effects on stocks as well as the tracking of economic costs and revenue from fishing activity. However, in practice model complexity will be limited by the needs of the modelling project, by the availability of data and by the modelling project timeline.
By incorporating Bayesian methods, including prior probability distributions, the BIOMAS system enables users to explore the uncertainty surrounding a limited number of parameter values and to incorporate this uncertainty into the model results. Sensitivity analyses can be run against virtually all model parameters providing insight into the key drivers for the model and likely candidates for Bayesian priors. A number of management indicators are provided for all stocks and fleets in the model including stock depletion, catch weights, age- and length-frequencies, discard mortality estimates and fleet profits – each with Bayesian-based confidence intervals. Such indicators become the primary means of comparing the effectiveness of alternative management strategies when using the system forecasting capabilities. Through the inclusion of stochastic processes, such as process error and environmental and pricing fluctuations, each management strategy can also be evaluated for its robustness to such uncertainty.
The ability to reflect more of our uncertainty in modelled outcomes, which tools such as BIOMAS provide, can unfortunately come at the expense of clarity in the outcomes. This is only because these models better encompass our lack of knowledge about fishery systems. Fortunately, such modelling tools can also provide us with a clearer understanding of the main sources of this uncertainty. Furthermore, the unique design of the BIOMAS system allows users to undertake ‘research strategy evaluations’ in which the costs and benefits of different forms of research can be compared, allowing managers and research leaders to see more clearly the benefits of targeted research to reduce these uncertainties.

However, research approaches that consider human–nature interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant fisheries are scarce. As such, we measured and modeled marine fisheries catches at local and regional scales over 65 years (1950–2014), assessed cross-scalar interactions among fishing types (artisanal, subsistence, industrial, recreational), and predicted future catches using the metacoupling framework, a new approach for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant fisheries (metacouplings). Across taxa examined (mahi-mahi [Coryphaena hippurus], Atlantic bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus], cods [Gadidae]), 75% of catches (8.5 million metric tons [MMT]) were made by nations in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs; Type 1 fishing). However, catches in adjacent EEZs (Type 2 fishing, 1.0 MMT) and distant EEZs and the high seas (Type 3 fishing, 1.9 MMT) increased substantially for all taxa at certain times, becoming consistently important for tuna and cods after 1980. Moreover, Types 1–3 fishing interacted in ways that affect humans differentially across fisheries. For instance, tuna artisanal and subsistence catches (Type 1) decreased with increasing Type 2 and Type 3 industrial fishing, respectively. Cod subsistence catches declined with increasing Type 2/3 industrial fishing and Type 1 artisanal fishing, whereas fishing-type interactions were largely positive for mahi-mahi, causing catches to increase across sectors. Overall, metacouplings affect humans in positive and negative ways that vary across scales and fisheries systems, galvanizing the need for metacoupling-informed fisheries research, policy, and management programs.

Combining a synthetic fisheries resource assessment model with a dynamic computable general equilibrium model (DCGEM), the research challenges the belief that overexploited fish stocks inevitably lead to extinction. It highlights the sensitivity of the fishing sector and its sustainability to changes in fishing effort and fluctuations in fuel prices, emphasizing the risks of overexploitation in the medium and long term, even under initially acceptable conditions. The key takeaway is the importance of maintaining balanced catch levels and fishing efforts below their recommended theoretical threshold to ensure sustainable fisheries. The study brings original insights, providing practical policy implications and advocating for continuous monitoring along with adaptive management strategies.

Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.

However there is to date negligible generation of electricity from wave. Many devices have been proposed without convergence on a particular design as there has been for wind. We are here concerned with a multi-float attenuator type M4 which has been widely tested in wave basins and modelled by linear diffraction/radiation methods. Potential of MW capacity for grid supply has been demonstrated at many sites. To advance development, small scale ocean tests are being planned for Albany, Western Australia where summer wind-wave conditions in King George Sound will excite the device giving principal absorption with mean periods in the range 2 - 3.5  seconds (or peak periods of 2.5 – 4.5 s). The aim is to learn about most aspects of ocean deployment from wave climate and environment planning to realistic electricity generation, albeit at kW scale. In this paper the emphasis is on the specification of electrical drive train (power take off) which requires the input of torque time variation for the wave conditions on the site, as described by a scatter diagram. First a linear time domain wave multi-float model (Fortran) is set up for the particular 121 configuration, shown in Fig. 1. Such models have been used and validated against wave basin tests for similar configurations. This is then converted into state-space form in Matlab. This is highly efficient and suited for real time PTO control in Simulink. Fig. 2 shows the main components of the electrical drive train, including the gearbox, generator, super-capacitors, power electronic converters and resistor bank to dissipate electricity. Bespoke Matlab models will be run for the wave conditions in the scatter diagram to check that components are suitably rated for normal sea-states, and are safely protected through electrical power-limiting control in high sea states. Simulated electrical generator results will be shown for typical sea states, with some power-limiting. Instrumentation will be specified. Only uni-directional waves are considered in this paper. Ultimately the efficacy of the system will be demonstrated in ocean conditions.

Reflecting this concern, the paper develops a novel marine resource allocation module which augments a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, calibrated on Scottish data. This allows simulations with varying degrees of differential productivity of the marine resource across alternative uses. Simulation results with the model show that increasing OWFs can impose substantial negative impacts on seafood supply. Extensive analysis is undertaken to test the sensitivity of the model results to changes in the heterogeneity of the marine resource between sectors and the degree of substitution between capital and the marine resource in the competing sectors. The outcomes of this analysis support policies to develop the integrated management of food and energy production in the marine environment. This includes spatial integration and the use of tools such as co-location in policy implementation. They also highlight the potential for the substitution of capital for the marine resource in the OWF sector as a means of substantially reducing the negative impact on the Fishing sector.

However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals' actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries' formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management's efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model. (2) Income inequality outcomes are associated with changes in cooperative trade relationships. When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers' income. We observe an offset of this loss in income by including cooperative relationships between fish traders (oligopoly) in the model. These relationships break down following species distribution changes and result in an increase in prices fishers receive. Finally, (3) our social-ecological model simulations show that the current fishery development program, which seeks to increase fishers' income through an increase in domestic market demand, is supported by predictions from the simple bioeconomic model, may increase income inequality between fishers and traders. Our findings highlight the real and urgent need to re-think fisheries management models in the context of small-scale fisheries and climate change worldwide to encompass social relationship dynamics.

Although nutrient-rich seafood can play a prominent role in resolving this challenge, seafood from capture fisheries is currently partly wasted. Here we quantified the nutrient contribution from capture fisheries through a hypothetical scenario that assumed all captured seafood and byproducts from seafood processing would be used for human consumption. Our simulations show that available seafood per capita can be doubled without increasing the pressure on global fisheries when all reported, illegal, and discarded capture is used as food, complemented with processing byproducts. In such a scenario, seafood contributes greatly to daily nutrient requirements – e.g., omega-3 can be fully met. Although uncertainty should be considered, these results indicate that putting the whole fish on the table can increase nutrient availability from capture fisheries substantially and sustainably.

Whereas great strides have been made over the last several decades at moving toward ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM), largely through the development of integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs), the inclusion of human dimensions into these efforts has often been fragmentary and, in juxtaposition to the biophysical dynamics, sometimes even seemingly superficial. This presents a great challenge to the accuracy and applicability of these results, as the lack of appropriate incorporation of humans can be problematic in terms of both social and biophysical consequences. This study systematically documents current social science understanding of the multiple human dimensions that should be incorporated within ecosystem assessments and the overall approach to each of these within IEAs and other EBFM efforts. These dimensions include the multi-faceted nature of human well-being, heterogeneity in human well-being derived from fisheries, adaptive behaviors, and cumulative effects. The systematic inclusion of these dimensions into IEAs is then laid out in a conceptual framework that details how a perturbation reverberates through a fisheries system and the iterative approach that should be undertaken to understand its impacts on human dimensions. This framework is supplemented with a data collection scheme that is intended to facilitate operationalization. The detailed examination of incorporating human dimensions within IEAs presented in this study should further resonate with other ecosystem assessment efforts, providing not just ample evidence of the need for moving beyond simplistic assumptions of human homogeneity but a means of systematically integrating a more realistic and representative perspective.

To understand the generic social-water interactions and obtain management implications for green-red loop systems, we develop a SYWM meta-model that conceptualises high-level social-environmental components and formulates their interactions into casual loops. This meta-model is evaluated via structural equation modelling using global datasets. Red- and green-loop scenarios are constructed to investigate the SYWM differences, and mediation analysis is conducted to quantify the reciprocal effects through the loops. Results show a critically weak causal link (0.22) from environmental state to quality of life, implying that the current water management performances have not been successfully incorporated for guiding further social development. Green- and red-loop systems have different direct causal effects in each link, which drives the corresponding behaviour. Red-loop systems have stronger total effects in causal links within the human system, depicting their strengths in socio-economic and water management decision-making. In contrast, green-loop systems have stronger total effects within the natural system, which symbolises receiving more environmental feedback. A sustainable SYWM that enhances both decision-making and feedback is recommended for green-red loop systems. The meta-model provides a platform for interdisciplinary collaborations and practical tools development that implements systems thinking in water management for sustainable development.

Recent field manipulation experiments in stream food chains found that seasonal timing and duration of terrestrial prey inputs affected the feeding behavior, growth, and maturation of fish predators, caused predator‐mediated indirect effects on aquatic prey, and modified trophic‐cascading effects on ecosystem processes (i.e., litter decomposition). These experiments described impacts of resource phenological changes over a few month period, but long‐term impacts of continued changes in resource phenology are unknown. Here, we develop a mathematical model to extrapolate long‐term predictions about the effects of changes in resource phenology from the results of field manipulation experiments. The model predicts that advanced timing generally decreases aquatic prey and litter processing and prolonged duration will either increase or decrease aquatic prey and litter processing depending on the total amount and pre‐disturbed timing and duration of terrestrial prey inputs. Our modeling approach clarifies that stage‐specific responses of life history processes in fish (i.e., growth, maturation, and reproduction) to phenological changes in terrestrial prey inputs mediate indirect effects on aquatic prey and litter processing. We argue that stage‐specific responses of life history processes are an integral part of the mechanisms with which to predict the consequences of phenological species interactions at the community and ecosystem levels.

However, research approaches that consider human–nature interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant fisheries are scarce. As such, we measured and modeled marine fisheries catches at local and regional scales over 65 years (1950–2014), assessed cross-scalar interactions among fishing types (artisanal, subsistence, industrial, recreational), and predicted future catches using the metacoupling framework, a new approach for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant fisheries (metacouplings). Across taxa examined (mahi-mahi [Coryphaena hippurus], Atlantic bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus], cods [Gadidae]), 75% of catches (8.5 million metric tons [MMT]) were made by nations in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs; Type 1 fishing). However, catches in adjacent EEZs (Type 2 fishing, 1.0 MMT) and distant EEZs and the high seas (Type 3 fishing, 1.9 MMT) increased substantially for all taxa at certain times, becoming consistently important for tuna and cods after 1980. Moreover, Types 1–3 fishing interacted in ways that affect humans differentially across fisheries. For instance, tuna artisanal and subsistence catches (Type 1) decreased with increasing Type 2 and Type 3 industrial fishing, respectively. Cod subsistence catches declined with increasing Type 2/3 industrial fishing and Type 1 artisanal fishing, whereas fishing-type interactions were largely positive for mahi-mahi, causing catches to increase across sectors. Overall, metacouplings affect humans in positive and negative ways that vary across scales and fisheries systems, galvanizing the need for metacoupling-informed fisheries research, policy, and management programs.

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in harvesting the mesopelagic zone to produce fish feed for aquaculture. However, great uncertainties exist in how the mesopelagic zone interacts with the climate and food webs, presenting a dilemma for policy. Here, we investigate the consequences of potential policies relating to mesopelagic harvest quotas with a dynamic social-ecological modeling approach, combining system dynamics and global sensitivity analyses informed by participatory modeling. Our analyses reveal that, in simulations of mesopelagic fishing scenarios, uncertainties about mesopelagic fish population dynamics have the most pronounced influence on potential outcomes. The analysis also shows that prioritizing the development of the fishing industry over environmental protection would lead to a significantly higher social cost of climate change to society. Given the large uncertainties and the potential large impacts on oceanic carbon sequestration, a precautionary approach to developing mesopelagic fisheries is warranted.

It is also one of the most exploited freshwater fish species. Fishing, pollution and environmental changes in the Orinoquia region of Colombia have considerably reduced its population size. We analysed the population dynamics of P. mariae during an annual river cycle, including extreme drought and flood scenarios, by means of a mathematical model and simulations. The model we propose is novel because it relates biological, ecological and environmental factors to the population dynamics, including reproduction, growth in size and biomass of fish, recruitment, predation, fishing mortality and river flow. The proposed mathematical model apparently gives an approximate description of the population dynamics of P. mariae for 2010 because a good fit of the model to the catch data of the species of that year was obtained. The simulations showed that the first 3 months of the year are crucial for the species because this is when it is most affected by a combination of fishing, biological factors which increase natural mortality (e.g. upstream migration and predation) and environmental factors (e.g. low river flow). Hypothetical scenarios show that local extinction could occur if fishing were to increase and river flow were to decrease.

Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.

We describe a qualitative systems-thinking informed approach building on preexisting CLDs, published evidence, and expert/stakeholder consultation and reflect on our experience applying this to the early stages of two nature-based solution (NBS) evaluations. We reflect on our experience and suggest that CLDs can be usefully employed to develop systems-informed research propositions to inform subsequent empirical evaluation.

Consequently, a vast number of development initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social, economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring. However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing “flow”,“addition”, and “deletion” effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments:(1) megafauna conservation,(2) alternative livelihood programs,(3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the importance of development initiatives in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

At all stages of ports and vessels operations planning, arrival times are key milestones. Therefore, the variation of vessels’ arrival times affects port operations and causes disruptions along the global port chain. For this reason, intelligent systems are needed to predict vessels’ estimated time of arrival to speed up rescheduling operations in case of perturbation. This study addresses the problem of predicting bulk vessels’ estimated time of arrival to the destination port. For that, we propose an approach based on Deep Learning sequence models and using different data sources including the Automatic Identification System historical traffic data.

Therefore, there is a need for reducing ship security risks in relation to antagonistic threats such as piracy. The aim of this study is to identify challenges for ship operators when developing their ship security management. Furthermore, this study also investigates two central aspects in the analysis: understanding the threat and understanding how a security threat affects the crew and operation of the ship. It is clear from the analysis that the importance of subjective aspects beyond a ship operators’ direct control is high. This seems to be the fact for all aspects of the risk management process. The situation is also dynamic as the security risk, as well as the risk perception, can change dramatically even though there are no actual operational changes. As a result, the ship security management process is highly iterative and depends on situations on board as well as conditions out of the ship operator’s control. In order to make ship security manageable, the risk management has to put particular focus on methodological understanding, relevant system understanding and well-defined risk acceptance criteria as well as on including all levels of the organization in the risk reduction implementation and on a continuous monitoring.

However, its environmental impact requires a review of its sustainability, including the analysis of its social, economic and environmental balance, and the evaluation of its impact on port cities receiving cruise ships. The purpose of this document is twofold: First, to analyze the relationship between air quality, as an environmental variable, and the volume of cruise ships and passengers that visit a port with the aim of generating information. Secondly, it is intended to develop an index, based on the information already available that allows cities to predict the impact of this activity, so that decisions are made to alleviate these effects. Methods: The primary data taken monthly for the period 2006–2017, related to the level of emissions and the number of cruises and passengers, are used as a basis. A regression analysis is performed to determine the relationship between air pollution and the number of tourists coming from the cruise ships. As a contribution, the results show the influence of this type of tourism on environmental indicators. In addition, in an original way, a regression function is established that allows estimating the future impact of the cruise industry in the ports cities. So that, cities can prevent this type of environmental impact. This will make it easier for the cruise tourism industry to develop more sustainable models in the long term.

As a result, the ship security management process is highly iterative and depends on situations on board as well as conditions out of the ship operator’s control. In order to make ship security manageable, the risk management has to put particular focus on methodological understanding, relevant system understanding and well-defined risk acceptance criteria as well as on including all levels of the organization in the risk reduction implementation and on a continuous monitoring.

Current debate centres on whether interventions such as marine protected areas (MPAs) promote co-benefits or trade-offs among multiple goals such as poverty alleviation, food security and protection of marine resources. Resolving this question is hindered by a lack of quantitative impact evaluations of concurrent ecological and social co-benefits of MPAs. Here we use a statistical matching approach to examine whether MPAs are associated with co-benefits or trade-offs between reef fish abundances and measures of human well-being, including income, diet and food security in the Mesoamerican region. We find that highly protected areas (HPAs) with stringent fishing restrictions tend to support high mean abundances and stable or increasing trends in fish abundances compared with unprotected sites and ‘general use zones’ of MPAs. At the same time, indicators of income and food security were elevated in communities near MPAs, especially HPAs, compared with communities far from MPAs. Finally, proximity to MPAs and to reefs with high fish abundance were both positively associated with well-being across space. Together, these results provide quantitative evidence of co-benefits for fish and people associated with MPAs, highlighting the potential value of MPAs in achieving multiple sustainable development goals.

It suggested that, as the potentials for intermodalism are not directly exploited by commercial organizations, port authorities should take the lead: have a vision on the hinterland, identify markets to be reached by intermodal transport and bring various parties together to start new connections. Today, the content of this article by Van Klink and Van den Berg (1998) remains, to a large extent, valid. The only difference is that market circumstances have significantly changed. Container volumes have almost tripled, the intermodal transport market has become much more competitive and the attention for the environmental impact of transport has substantially increased. Despite the growth of intermodal transport, there is still a huge potential for further growth because in most (European) ports the share of road transport is still dominant.

Consequently, a vast number of development initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social, economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring. However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology encompassing “flow”,“addition”, and “deletion” effects and investigate them across four types of sustainable development initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments:(1) megafauna conservation,(2) alternative livelihood programs,(3) mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences. Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention. Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the importance of development initiatives in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

This paper considers the establishment of the demonstration zones as a quasi-natural experiment. Utilizing panel data from 53 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2006 to 2020, a time‑varying difference‑in‑difference model is applied to examine whether this ecological policy can promote the elevation of green development levels of the marine economy, aiming to achieve a harmonious balance between clear waters and green mountains and mountains of gold and silver. The results indicate that the establishment of the demonstration zones significantly enhances the level of green development of the marine economy. Technological innovation and industrial structure are identified as two crucial mechanisms influencing green development of the marine economy, both exhibiting positive mediating effects. The impact of the establishment of the demonstration zones on the promotion of green development of the marine economy is more pronounced in the East China coastal region and the Central-south coastal region compared to the North China and Northeast coastal regions. Additionally, this policy effectively stimulates green development of the marine economy in medium and small cities and non-resource-based cities. Finally, corresponding policy recommendations are proposed from the perspectives of differentiated strategies, industrial structure adjustments, and technological innovation mechanisms.

Nonetheless, the mechanism between guests' experience, hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, altruism and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) intention remains unexplored. This study utilized the stimuli–organism–response (SOR) model to advance the understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying guests' experience, well-being and eWOM intention by further integrating altruism as a moderator. In total, 445 questionnaires from China were analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results illustrated significant mediating effects of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being between guests' experience and eWOM intention. Unexpectedly, altruism had no moderating effect on eWOM intention. Theoretically, this paper extends the SOR model's application to experiencescapes by describing novel stimuli and organisms, and to enrich the understanding of well-being in tourism and hospitality. Practically, this paper provides guidelines for resort hotel marketers and operators to identify the mechanism of guests' voluntary eWOM behavior and to devise strategies for encouraging more active eWOM.

Based on the contingent valuation method, this paper evaluates residents’ preference for marine ecological restoration, and shows that residents show the strongest preference for the increase in the number of intertidal organisms, followed by the improvement in coastal environment and seawater quality. The mean willingness to pay (WTP) for a large improvement in marine environment is predicted and is 108.96 CNY/a. Additionally, a comprehensive framework, which integrates social capital theory and the theory of planned behavior, is constructed to explore the influencing factors of residents’ WTP from the social and psychological levels. The results suggest that behavioral attitude, perceived behavioral control, and social network show a significantly direct impact on residents’ WTP. Furthermore, a mechanism is constructed from pushing power and pulling power to effectively promote public participation.

This is clearly reflected by the many (EU) research calls explicitly asking for stakeholder involvement. The way in which to involve stakeholders in a meaningful way is however not all that clearly defined. In the EU funded project Options for Delivering Ecosystem-Based Marine Management (ODEMM) an explicit question was the development of options for alternative governance settings, including stakeholder involvement, to implement the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the EU. In order to arrive at these possible alternative governance set-ups the ODEMM project developed a layered methodology, including structured and unstructured interviews, a survey and roundtable discussions to develop diverse governance options for future ecosystem based models at the regional seas.

Due to the socioeconomic and ecological importance of these areas, predicting relevant indicators of the ecosystem state on sub-seasonal to interannual timescales is gaining increasing attention. Depending on the application, forecasts may be sought for variables and indicators spanning physics (e.g., sea level, temperature, currents), chemistry (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, pH), and biology (from viruses to top predators). Many components of the marine ecosystem are known to be influenced by leading modes of climate variability, which provide a physical basis for predictability. However, prediction capabilities remain limited by the lack of a clear understanding of the physical and biological processes involved, as well as by insufficient observations for forecast initialization and verification. The situation is further complicated by the influence of climate change on ocean conditions along coastal areas, including sea level rise, increased stratification, and shoaling of oxygen minimum zones. Observations are thus vital to all aspects of marine forecasting: statistical and/or dynamical model development, forecast initialization, and forecast validation, each of which has different observational requirements, which may be also specific to the study region. Here, we use examples from United States (U.S.) coastal applications to identify and describe the key requirements for an observational network that is needed to facilitate improved process understanding, as well as for sustaining operational ecosystem forecasting. We also describe new holistic observational approaches, e.g., approaches based on acoustics, inspired by Tara Oceans or by landscape ecology, which have the potential to support and expand ecosystem modeling and forecasting activities by bridging global and local observations.

Human activities have been recognized as significant contributors to profound changes in marine ecology. However, these observable alterations often represent a cumulative effect that intertwines with less apparent natural influences. This research delved into the relationships between environmental factors and marine life in the waters adjacent to Nanwan Bay, Kenting, Taiwan. Specifically, it examined the linear relationships and the degree of changes between environmental factors and marine life. To achieve these objectives, factor analysis was employed to uncover potential latent variables that could impact marine organisms, with these variables named based on previous studies and related literature. The findings led to the development of a structural equation model (SEM) to represent the marine ecology of Nanwan Bay. The results accentuated the significant influence of primary productivity and nutrient levels on the assemblage of marine life. The application of SEM methodology sheds more light on the degree of impact natural and anthropogenic interference have on marine ecosystems.

Currently, the global desalination industry is rapidly developing. In China’s new development plan, large-scale development of the seawater desalination industry is also an important strategic goal. However, compared to the technological development of the seawater desalination industry, its marketization is affected by various factors, and its development level is still relatively low. Therefore, based on real industry data, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model for seawater desalination enterprises, water supply enterprises, and the government, and identifies several entry barriers for seawater desalination in China. The results include: (1) For seawater desalination to enter the market in China, government supervision limit should be no greater than 400,000 tons per day, about 13.8% of total seawater desalination scale. (2) The entry cost should be no more than 10 million yuan per day for seawater desalination, which is equivalent to approximately 18.25 trillion yuan during a five-year period. Finally, (3) political relatedness should be at least 2.0 for seawater desalination to take place, and 3.0 for it to develop in full swing. The paper also discusses the division of state- and foreign-owned water companies and reveals that government subsidies are only effective if foreign-owned companies seek rents. Based on the findings of the study, we propose pertinent policy recommendations including top-level planning, desalinated water infrastructure development, subsidy policy implementation, and public engagement. These recommendations aim to aid the Chinese government in fostering the desalination sector.

The UK marine environment is relatively data rich, yet the links between ecosystem and several ecosystem services and linkages between services are poorly described. A workshop with 35 marine scientists was used to create a conceptual model that links ecosystem components and key processes to four services they provide and to highlight trade-offs between them.

China, as one of the pioneers in establishing comprehensive MSP policies, has created a well-developed marine planning structure—known as the “multi-rule-in-one—with Marine Functional Zoning (MFZ) serving as a cornerstone for the country's coastal economic and environmental development. Despite its significance, limited studies have presented the practical application of MSP/MFZ policies upon tourism exploitation in coastal regions. This paper fills this research gap by thoroughly examining China's marine planning structure, the implementation of provincial MFZ policy, and the operational mechanisms of these strategies. The analysis focuses on the Xiasha Beach Resort, a case study exemplifying the coordinated efforts required among governments, scientists, and the public for the successful implementation of MFZ policy. Findings from the Xiasha Beach Resort highlight the importance of robust tourist market management, a shift from hard seawall structures towards more eco-friendly alternatives, and a high degree of collaboration among key stakeholders. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem-based restoration technology that maintains the integrity of the beach-dune system, fosters diverse vegetation, and encourages adaptive measures such as environmental capacity control. The sustainability of the MSP approach hinges on wide and diverse public participation, as national MSP policies foster trust, credit, and feedback from local citizens, promoting necessary policy adjustments. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights for domestic and international regions seeking to harmonize MSP operations to achieve high-quality coastal economic development and environmental protection targets.

The current study adopts the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) concept and develops a system dynamic (SD) based decision support system (DSS). The SD model, built as a DSS to facilitate scenario analysis, can solve the complex coastal zone management problem. Four subsystems, socio-economic, environmental, biological, and management, join with the SD model configuration for integrated assessment of the particular problem. The model identifies four critical management strategy variables, including land development, wastewater treatment, local fish consumption rate, and entrance fee collection, and presents users with a user-friendly DSS interface. Several scenario analyses are conducted and presented in this paper. Decision makers can also fine tune DSS variables and evaluate preferable scenarios through simulations. Sustainable management strategies for the coral reef ecosystem can hopefully be developed using the DSS and implemented in the near future.

Maintaining the health of the bay ecosystem has national and international significances, as it enhances the environmental regulation function and resource development value of the region. This study aims to examine the evolution trend and regulatory mechanism of ecosystem health in Laizhou Bay (LZB), China.
 
Methods: A comprehensive DPSIR-based indicator framework is established, comprising 40 representative indicators of the natural environment status, ecological service function, and social values of the LZB ecosystem. The subjective and objective integrated weighting method is applied to determine the indicator weight. The Ecosystem Health Index is then calculated to assess the LZB ecosystem health from 1980 to 2019 and key influencing factors are identified through the scenario analysis.
 
Results: The results show that the health status of the LZB ecosystem has fluctuated and then increased overall over the past 40 years, with a fairly healthy state in the 1980s, an unhealthy state in 2005, and then a rebound to a subhealthy state. The key factors affecting the LZB ecosystem health are mostly pressure items, with land-based pollution, particularly agricultural non-point source pollution, having a more significant impact than reclamations.
 
Discussion: Reasonable recommendations are finally put forward on improving the ecosystem health in the study area, including refining the legislation and integrated mechanism related to regional management, building a coordinated land-sea governance system and exploring new technologies for integrated marine management. This study fills the knowledge gap of ecosystem health assessment for the entire LZB in such a long-time scale, and the research outcomes are expected to provide scientific references and guidance for decision-making and social-economic sustainable development in LZB and other bays.

A cumulative ecological impacts of reclamation (RCEI) was established in our study based on ecological influence characteristics of different reclamation types, and the attenuation effect of reclamation on adjacent areas. It was characterized by spatio-temporal features in decades. Here, we estimated that the cumulative reclamation area in the Bohai Sea from 1985 to 2018 was 5839.5 km2. Under the influence of human activity, proportions of the industrial and urban boundary, marine construction boundaries (e.g., ports, wharves, and bridges), and protective dams were increased significantly, which led to a sharp increase of the RCEI. In addition, spatio-temporal changes of reclamation were affected by the combination of population growth, economic development, urbanization, industrialization, and marine industry development in coastal cities. These results provided an important historical reference for tracking future development of the Bohai Sea by humans and provided basic data support for the development and protection of the ocean.

When integrating social and ecological dynamics, which are often studied separately, one has to deal with different modeling paradigms, levels of analysis, temporal and spatial scales, and data availabilities in the social and ecological domains. A major challenge, for instance, is linking the emergent patterns from individual micro-level human decisions to system level processes such as reinforcing feedbacks determining the state of the ecosystem. We propose building a hybrid model that combines a system dynamics with an agent-based approach to address some of these challenges. In particular, we present a procedure for model development and analysis that successively builds up complexity and understanding of model dynamics, particular with respect to feedbacks between the social and ecological system components. The proposed steps allow for a systematic increase of the coupling between the submodels and building confidence in the model before deploying it to study the coupled dynamics. The procedure consists of steps for (i) specifying the characteristics of the link between the social and ecological systems, (ii) validating the decoupled submodels, (iii) doing sensitivity analysis of the decoupled submodels with respect to the drivers from the respective other subsystem and, finally (iv) analyzing the coupled model. We illustrate the procedure and discuss opportunities and limitations of hybrid models against the background of an archetypical SES case study, namely the restoration of a turbid lake. Our approach exemplifies how a hybrid model is used to unpack SES complexity and analyze interactions between ecological dynamics and micro-level human actions. We discuss the benefits and challenges of combining a system dynamics models as an aggregated view with an agent-based model as a disaggregated view to improve social-ecological system understanding.

Few studies assess the potential for restoring a deteriorating ecosystem that is on a transition pathway toward an undesirable state. During the transition, feedbacks that stabilize the new regime are still weak, providing an opportunity to reverse the ongoing shift. Here, we present a social-ecological model that explores both how transient social processes affect ecological dynamics in the vicinity of a tipping point to reinforce the desired state and how social mechanisms of policy implementation affect restoration time. We simulate transitions of a lake, policy making, and behavioral change by lake polluters to study the time lags that emerge as a response to the transient, deteriorating lake state. We found that restoration time is most sensitive to the timing of policy making, but that the transient dynamics of the social processes determined outcomes in nontrivial ways. Social pressure to adopt costly technology, in our case on-site sewage treatment, was up to a degree capable of compensating for delays in municipal policy making. Our analysis of interacting social and ecological time lags in the transient phase of a shallow lake highlights opportunities for restoration that a stable state analysis would miss. We discuss management perspectives for navigating critical feedbacks in a transitioning social-ecological system. The understanding of transient dynamics and the interaction with social time lags can be more relevant than solely stable states and tipping points.

This is a complex challenge for institutions who manage lakes but are usually less familiar with non-linear dynamics, slow and fast influences on water quality and how to manage those from a social-ecological perspective. We extend a well-known minimal model of shallow lake regime shifts to enable simulations over time with short- and long-term management measures (nutrient reduction, trawling, planting of aquatic vegetation). While we explore the mathematical conditions for ecological bistability, we also identify the necessary and sufficient extent of measures to restore the clear water state. Restoration scenarios evaluated by trajectories in the state space demonstrate the increased effectiveness from combined measures even when considering countereffective activities such as pike fishing. But, single measures alone may delay or even miss the overall restoration target. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of understanding transient dynamics where stable state analyses alone remain elusive about alternative ways to interact with bistability. We conclude that successful management of bistable systems, and particularly shallow temperate lakes, needs careful balancing between short-term improvements and long-term influence on the systems state.

In its expansion strategy, technical, environmental and socioeconomic aspects should be taken into account to identify suitable areas for development of wave energy projects. In this research we provide a novel approach for suitable site identification for wave energy farms. To achieve this objective, we (i) developed a conceptual framework, considering technical, environmental and conflicts for space aspects that play a role on the development of those projects, and (ii) it was operationalized in a Bayesian Network, by building a spatially explicit model adopting the Spanish and Portuguese Economic Exclusive Zones as case study. The model results indicate that 1723 km2 and 17,409 km2 are highly suitable or suitable for the development of wave energy projects (i.e. low potential conflicts with other activities and low ecological risk). Suitable areas account for a total of 2.5 TWh∙m−1 energy resource. These areas are placed between 82 and 111 m water depth, 18–30 km to the nearest port, 21–29 km to the nearest electrical substation onshore, with 143–170 MWh m−1 mean annual energy resource and having 124–150 of good weather windows per year for construction and maintenance work. The approach proposed supports scientists, managers and industry, reducing uncertainties during the consenting process, by identifying the most relevant technical, environmental and socioeconomic factors when authorising wave energy projects.

Existing models, however, are highly complex, are computationally expensive, and depend on many input parameters; this limits our ability to explore planform erosion of rocky coasts over long timescales (thousands to millions of years) and over a range of conditions. In this paper, we present a simplified cellular model of coastline evolution in closed basins through uniform erosion and wave-driven erosion. Uniform erosion is modeled as a constant rate of retreat. Wave erosion is modeled as a function of fetch, the distance over which the wind blows to generate waves, and the angle between the incident wave and the shoreline. This reduced-complexity model can be used to evaluate how a detachment-limited coastal landscape reflects climate, sea-level history, material properties, and the relative influence of different erosional processes.

Fermented products like Prahoc may play a range of beneficial roles nutritionally, culturally, and financially. However, the use of freshwater fish and long-term storage may also pose food safety risks of parasites and microorganisms. We conducted a mixed-methods study of Prahoc to describe the complex risks and benefits of this food that included semi-structured interviews (prahoc-producing households, n = 22; small and medium enterprises n = 6), production observation, sample collection and analysis of nutrient composition and food safety parameters. Nutrient composition analysis showed that while Prahoc contributes small amounts of zinc, iron, and other key minerals to the diet, it is also very high in sodium (∼101,621 mg kg-1). Food safety analyses showed that while further tests are needed to resolve Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio risks, all samples were in compliance with the Cambodia Standards for Prahoc, and there was no evidence of parasites. Participants described Prahoc as playing an essential dietary and cultural role, and also making important contributions to household welfare, particularly within households and businesses that sold Prahoc. Despite the potential risks of microbial food safety and high sodium intake, Prahoc production offers benefits by adding value to fresh fish, reducing loss and waste, and preserving the harvest. However, Prahoc production depends on fish availability and is limited by declining access and high prices. Thus, freshwater fisheries management should take into account Prahoc production activities, an important value chain activity that contributes to the livelihoods of rural Cambodian communities.

This was investigated by estimation of human intake using versatile modeling tools (e.g., a herring population model and a bioenergetics model). We used a probabilistic approach to account for the variation in human intake of organochlorines originating from the variation among herring individuals. Our estimates were compared with present precautionary limits and recommendation for use. The results show that present consumption levels and frequencies of herring give a high probability of exceeding recommended intake limits of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. Furthermore, our results clearly demonstrate that in the risk management of dioxinlike organochlorines, regulating fishing (in this case increasing fishing pressure) is a far less effective way to decrease the risk than regulating the consumption of herring. Increased fishing would only slightly decrease organochlorine concentrations of herring in the Finnish fish market.

Previous studies have indicated both negative and positive impacts on marine biodiversity during the construction and operation of OWFs, but the impacts of decommissioning remain largely unknown. Assessments of marine biodiversity impacts are now needed to support science-based decisions as the first OWFs are approaching decommissioning. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) offers a quantitative and transparent approach to impact assessment but does currently not adequately cover marine biodiversity impacts. As a first step in developing an LCIA method, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the links between offshore infrastructure decommissioning activities and their impacts on marine biodiversity. Links were delineated as impact pathways, providing the foundational framework for future LCIA development. We extended the scope of our study to oil and gas (O&G) platforms, given the similarities between the two types of offshore infrastructure and decommissioning activities. Our study identifies numerous impact pathways through which OWF decommissioning affects marine biodiversity. We found many similarities between impacts from the decommissioning of OWFs and O&G, but generally, more pathways were identified for O&G decommissioning. As the structures resemble each other, this study suggests that much knowledge can be brought from O&G decommissioning to OWF. We identified habitat change as particularly important when investigating impacts associated with offshore decommissioning, as several pressures may affect habitat change. The study also identified implications for developing a comprehensive LCIA method, including a scarcity of quantitative studies and empirical data, baseline definitions, as well as inconsistency in biodiversity metrics applied across reviewed studies. Importantly, the identified impact pathways provide the first step toward integrating marine biodiversity into LCIA in the context of the decommissioning of offshore structures.

However, research approaches that consider human–nature interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant fisheries are scarce. As such, we measured and modeled marine fisheries catches at local and regional scales over 65 years (1950–2014), assessed cross-scalar interactions among fishing types (artisanal, subsistence, industrial, recreational), and predicted future catches using the metacoupling framework, a new approach for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant fisheries (metacouplings). Across taxa examined (mahi-mahi [Coryphaena hippurus], Atlantic bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus], cods [Gadidae]), 75% of catches (8.5 million metric tons [MMT]) were made by nations in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs; Type 1 fishing). However, catches in adjacent EEZs (Type 2 fishing, 1.0 MMT) and distant EEZs and the high seas (Type 3 fishing, 1.9 MMT) increased substantially for all taxa at certain times, becoming consistently important for tuna and cods after 1980. Moreover, Types 1–3 fishing interacted in ways that affect humans differentially across fisheries. For instance, tuna artisanal and subsistence catches (Type 1) decreased with increasing Type 2 and Type 3 industrial fishing, respectively. Cod subsistence catches declined with increasing Type 2/3 industrial fishing and Type 1 artisanal fishing, whereas fishing-type interactions were largely positive for mahi-mahi, causing catches to increase across sectors. Overall, metacouplings affect humans in positive and negative ways that vary across scales and fisheries systems, galvanizing the need for metacoupling-informed fisheries research, policy, and management programs.

Coherent monitoring of the energy profile of fishing vessels through an energy audit can effectively identify sources of inefficiency, allowing for the deployment of well-informed and cost-efficient remedial interventions. We applied energy audits to a test fleet of ten vessels, representing three typical Mediterranean trawl fisheries: midwater pair trawl, bottom otter trawl, and Rapido beam trawl. Overall, these fisheries use approximately 2.9 litres of fuel per kilogram of landed fish, but the fuel consumption rate varies widely according to gear type and vessel size. This amount of fuel burned from capture to landing generates approximately 7.6 kg∙CO2/kg fish on average. Minimising impacts and energy consumption throughout the product chain may be another essential element needed to reduce the environmental costs of fishing.

The goals are to contribute to an efficient coordination work between local agencies that manage the use of ecosystem services, and to incorporate climate science and management options in coastal areas of Uruguay. We have identified and analysed climate forcing ENSO and the variables river flow and winds, which govern the location and displacement of the frontal system, where the capital city Montevideo is located, and the fluctuations of salinity. The study analyses the austral spring–summer period (October–March) from 1997/1998 to 2012/2013. Fish catch and beach quality were selected as examples of environmental impacts of climate forcing which are presented as a causality loop diagram (CLD): ENSO →(River flow, wind, rainfall) →(EFS displacement, Salinity), and state/impact indicators →(Fish catch, Beach quality). Institutional cooperation has been developed to incorporate climate adaptation regarding the Frontal System.

Offshore wind energy sector has been clearly the fastest in its development among other options, and development of new wind farms requires large ocean space. Therefore, there is a need of efficient spatial planning process, including the site selection constrained by technical (wind resource, coastal distance, seafloor) and environmental (impacts) factors and competence of uses. We present a novel approach, using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN), for an integrated spatially explicit site feasibility identification for offshore wind farms. Our objectives are to: (i) develop a spatially explicit model that integrates the technical, economic, environmental and social dimensions; (ii) operationalize the BBN model; (iii) implement the model at local (Basque Country) and regional (North East Atlantic and Western Mediterranean), and (iv) develop and analyse future scenarios for wind farm installation in a local case study. Results demonstrated a total of 1% (23 km2) of moderate feasibility areas in local scaled analysis, compared to 4% of (21,600 km2) very high, and 5% (30,000 km2) of high feasibility in larger scale analysis. The main challenges were data availability and discretization when trying to expand the model from local to regional level. The use of BBN models to determine the feasibility of offshore wind farm areas has been demonstrated adequate and possible, both at local and regional scales, allowing managers to take management decisions regarding marine spatial planning when including different activities, environmental problems and technological constraints.

Sustainable management system is needed to increase the production of tuna processing industry by still preserving its sustainability. This problem became more complex, due to the dynamic nature of ecosystems and other processes involved. This study developed a system dynamics model which integrates tuna stocks ecosystem, tuna processing industry development, social economic, and policy sub-models. This model was developed based on historical data, then developed into three development scenarios: without fish-catch limitation, limitation by Sustainable Maximum yield (MSY) and limitation by Maximum economic yield (MEY). System dynamic modeling was conducted to analyze sustainable tuna industry development based on various points of view, to accommodate stakeholder interest. The success of tuna processing industry development, were assessed from the increase of production values, the preservation of tuna and tuna-like fish stock in the environment, and also the improvement of social welfare. Simulations were carried out for 25 years to predict the condition of fish stocks in the future, based on current policies applied. Simulation results show that to develop tuna processing industry while maintaining the stock of tuna in its sustainable conditions, only limiting the fish catch was not enough, the process of integrating industry, socioeconomic and policy made by related institutions were also important.

These systems are typically highly dynamic and hard to predict, particularly in the context of rapid environmental change, where novel sets of conditions drive coupled socio-economic-environmental responses. Faced with these challenges, our tools for policy development, while informed by the past experience, must not be unduly constrained; they must allow equally for both the fine-tuning of successful existing approaches and the generation of novel ones in unbiased ways. We study ocean fisheries as an example class of complex human–environmental systems, and present a new model (POSEIDON) and computational approach to policy design. The model includes an adaptive agent-based representation of a fishing fleet, coupled to a simplified ocean ecology model. The agents (fishing boats) do not have programmed responses based on empirical data, but respond adaptively, as a group, to their environment (including policy constraints). This conceptual model captures qualitatively a wide range of empirically observed fleet behaviour, in response to a broad set of policies. Within this framework, we define policy objectives (of arbitrary complexity) and use Bayesian optimization over multiple model runs to find policy parameters that best meet the goals. The trade-offs inherent in this approach are explored explicitly. Taking this further, optimization is used to generate novel hybrid policies. We illustrate this approach using simulated examples, in which policy prescriptions generated by our computational methods are counterintuitive and thus unlikely to be identified by conventional frameworks.

Burrowing seabirds, as prevalent vertebrate consumers, have the potential to impact consumptive effects via adding marine nutrients to soil (i.e. resource subsidies) and non-consumptive effects via soil disturbance associated with excavating burrows (i.e. ecosystem engineering). However, the exact mechanisms by which they influence invertebrates are poorly understood. We examined how soil chemistry and plant and invertebrate communities changed across a gradient of seabird burrow density on two islands in northern New Zealand. Increasing seabird burrow density was associated with increased soil nutrient availability and changes in plant community structure and the abundance of nearly all the measured invertebrate groups. Increasing seabird densities had a negative effect on invertebrates that were strongly influenced by soil-surface litter, a positive effect on fungal-feeding invertebrates, and variable effects on invertebrate groups with diverse feeding strategies. Gastropoda and Araneae species richness and composition were also influenced by seabird activity. Generalized multilevel path analysis revealed that invertebrate responses were strongly driven by seabird engineering effects, via increased soil disturbance, reduced soil-surface litter, and changes in trophic interactions. Almost no significant effects of resource subsidies were detected. Our results show that seabirds, and in particular their non-consumptive effects, were significant drivers of invertebrate food web structure. Reductions in seabird populations, due to predation and human activity, may therefore have far-reaching consequences for the functioning of these ecosystems.

Now, renewable energy is a significant issue that must be considered seriously as a policy and in order to achieve energy sustainability on a global scale especially in whole developing countries. Also, since the role of renewable energy in sustainable development is remarkable, thus this article presents a comprehensive discussion of energy sustainability for urban areas with related energy indicators and technical analysis of a Hybrid Power System to show the importance of renewable energy to gain energy sustainability. This paper presents the feasibility of using PV-DG hybrid systems as the reliable energy by an economic and technical analysis in one of the southern cities of Iran use of HOMER software. Regarding the high average of solar radiation that is about 5.4 kWh/m2/d in Chabahar city, technical analysis of this system demonstrates that this city has a high capacity to producing the electrical energy via PV-diesel hybrid system with total electrical production amount of 10,575 kWh/yr from PV (8,447 kWh/yr) and Diesel system (2,128 kWh/yr). For do this work at the first, the required data is gathered from the meteorological organization of Iran and then technical and economic analysis is conducted with the Homer software.

Contamination of the aquatic ecosystem and unhygienic handling practices along the fish supply chain can lead to a contaminated fish. Consumption of raw or under cooked fish and fish products is a major source of fishborne infections in humans. Despite reports of fish contamination with foodborne pathogens in Ethiopia, information regarding the hygienic status of fish handling practices is limited. We assessed fish hygienic handling practices at production sites and along the fish supply chain in three towns in east Shewa zone of Oromia. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire interviews and personal observations. The study consisted of purposively selected respondents comprising of 50 fishermen, 10 retailers, 20 food establishments serving fish, and 120 consumers. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used to present the proportion of various actors along the fish production and supply chain and to compare the proportions of observations among the different categories respectively. We observed that the lakes were accessible to animals and exposed to chemical and microbial contaminations through rainwater run-off. Fish were processed under unhygienic practices like washing of filleted fish with lake water, indiscriminate processing at unhygienic landing sites, use of a single knife for processing all fish with infrequent washing and with no disinfection in between. Majority (70%; n = 10) of the retailers and all the food establishments transported fish in vehicles with no cold chain facilities. Good hygienic practices we observed were the use of refrigerators for storage in all retailers and 70% (n = 20) of the food establishments; 30% of retailers used vehicles with a cold chain facility for the transportation of fish. Over three-fourths (77%; n = 120) of the consumers preferred consuming raw fish; 80% of them lacked the knowledge of fishborne diseases. The study revealed a wide range of unhygienic handling practices along fish production and supply chain; lack of infrastructure for post-harvest fish handling and processing, lack of appropriate transportation facilities and presence of knowledge gaps regarding fish borne diseases.

However, at the same time, port production activities also consume various resources, such as water, electricity, coal, and land. In addition, ports inevitably produce waste—solid, water, gas, and other pollutants—which damages the environment of their hinterland cities, hindering the growth of urban GDP. Therefore, this study sought to build a reasonable system dynamics model to measure the positive and negative effects of ports on cities, and to put forward countermeasures and suggestions for promoting port–city green cooperative development. We selected Shanghai Port as a case study, estimated its parameters with 2010–2017 data, and tested the historical fitness of the model. We then carried out a scheme simulation by changing relevant parameters and comparing coordinated port–city development under different schemes. The simulation results show that increases in sea transportation activity and economic pull coefficients help to propel the growth of port–city GDP to a certain extent, but also cause environmental pollution and resource wastage. Therefore, effective energy-saving and emission-reduction measures are needed to achieve the coordinated development of economic growth and green environmental protection in ports and cities.

Previous research suggests that different dimensions of perceived risk, trust, and control interact in complex ways to affect inter-organizational collaborative performance, providing an administrative ‘architecture’ that enables partners to share resources, engage in teamwork, resolve conflict, and coordinate tasks and responsibilities while also allaying their concerns about the alliance. However, the extent to which different control mechanisms influence trust and mitigate the perceived risks of collaboration between the diverse organizations involved in transboundary fisheries management remains unclear. This paper presents the quantitative results of survey research conducted in the Salish Sea of North America, an ecosystem spanning the Canada-US border between British Columbia and Washington State. The survey instrument operationalizes a multi-dimensional trust-control-risk framework considered suitable for studying inter-organizational natural resource management (NRM) networks. The findings support descriptions of the Salish Sea as having fewer nation-to-nation governing bodies resulting in a lack of effective formal controls, high perceived regulatory risk, and low procedural trust attributes that can negatively affect the collaborative performance of the fishery management network. This study represents the first quantitative analysis of the complex relationships between different inter-organizational management strategies, trust dimensions, and perceived risks in transboundary fisheries governance, and offers new directions for future research on NRM collaboration.

However, at the same time, port production activities also consume various resources, such as water, electricity, coal, and land. In addition, ports inevitably produce waste—solid, water, gas, and other pollutants—which damages the environment of their hinterland cities, hindering the growth of urban GDP. Therefore, this study sought to build a reasonable system dynamics model to measure the positive and negative effects of ports on cities, and to put forward countermeasures and suggestions for promoting port–city green cooperative development. We selected Shanghai Port as a case study, estimated its parameters with 2010–2017 data, and tested the historical fitness of the model. We then carried out a scheme simulation by changing relevant parameters and comparing coordinated port–city development under different schemes. The simulation results show that increases in sea transportation activity and economic pull coefficients help to propel the growth of port–city GDP to a certain extent, but also cause environmental pollution and resource wastage. Therefore, effective energy-saving and emission-reduction measures are needed to achieve the coordinated development of economic growth and green environmental protection in ports and cities.

Phytoplankton is an important source of primary productivity in this ecosystem. Its future changes could affect Southern Ocean geochemistry, carbon export, and higher trophic organisms. To better protect Antarctica, three different marine protected areas (MPA) have been established in the Ross Sea region. Because time-continuous and regionally complete data are difficult to obtain in this region, we obtained data from ocean model outputs to understand the spatiotemporal variability of phytoplankton biomass in this region. This study explored the correlation between phytoplankton biomass and key environmental factors. Phytoplankton biomass peaks in February as temperatures rise and sea ice melts. Correlations also vary between different protected areas. The correlation between biomass, nitrate, and salinity in the Krill Research Zone (KRZ) area was significantly different from other protected areas. In addition, in the context of global warming, Antarctica lacks temperature perception. The model results show a downward trend in temperature and an increase in sea ice coverage in the western Ross Sea that other studies have also pointed to. How phytoplankton biomass will change in protected areas in the future is a question worth considering. Finally, the study simply simulates future regional trends by comparing the biomass distribution in hot years to average years. This will increase our knowledge of the polar system.

This paper explores the use of qualitative system dynamics tools and a participatory modelling approach to support scoping stages of an integrated sustainability assessment (ISA) process. To facilitate mapping of maritime sustainability issues in Portugal, a series of preparatory interviews allowed eliciting stakeholders’ perceptions and their alignment with current public policies. In the subsequent participatory modelling workshop, stakeholders deliberated on maritime problems and constructed causal loop diagrams, identifying feedback structures and voting on leverage points to intervene in the system. Overall results show that the process generated positive outcomes at individual and group levels, stimulating basic systems thinking knowledge and skills. Although further time for model iteration was suggested, the proposed approach promoted learning and a transition toward a shared and more holistic view of maritime problems and its underlying causal interrelationships. This is a promising result for the use of participatory modelling approaches as platforms supporting emerging ISA frameworks.

Despite progress in depicting social-ecological interdependency, focus is less on measuring universally applicable and quantitatively comparable fit. By reviewing international marine protected areas' fit problems and transforming qualitative subgraphs to quantitative submatrices, the modified Moran's I can measure social-ecological fit in worldwide scenarios. As an example, results of China's 6 Sousa chinensis marine protected areas include: (1) Quantitative calculations aligned with qualitative motifs, indicating a gradient of fit degrees and motif types; (2) Fit degree was significant at the 95% confidence level after of 10,000 randomizations; (3) Fit degrees could be predicted with over 90% accuracy by common network attributes including betweenness centrality, clustering centrality, degree centrality and eigenvector centrality in 10,000 cross-validations; (4) The development pathway, stages and resilience of fit were presented. Fit problems and solutions were categorized into four groups based on the fit degrees. Governance insights for international practitioners include enhancing access to ecological resources through strengthening connections, avoiding overexploitation of resources via values creation, and following the adaptation-transformation pathway in co-management programs. Without any environmental restrictions and species specifications, the mathematically defined indicator of fit can be applied to other social-ecological systems to offer optimization strategies locally and internationally. (1) For the Pearl River MPA with fit degree of 0.297, access to one exclusive and one shared resource (motif family V, high fit) is the most pronounced. Social actors such as residents and tourism enterprises experience ecological substitutability with shared access to Sousa chinensis and protected areas, while the government only has access to Sousa chinensis. Although the Xiamen and Pearl River MPAs are praised for locally based MPA programs (Zhu et al., 2021) and benign ecological environments (Bao et al., 2019), the relatively weak connection between the government and protected area itself limits their further advancement of fit degree. For example, illegal sand mining activities in the amphioxus protected areas and overlaps between conflicting functional zones were mentioned in the Xiamen MPA (Hou et al., 2022), and a decreasing trend of sediment load in the Pearl River Basin since the 1980s has also been detected (Wang et al., 2018). Reducing over-intensive sea use activities and alleviating ecological pressures by adjusting functional zones with greater economic stimulation to low-pressure areas are suggested.

The proposed management system considers the factors that determine the demand and supply of cruise passengers and the existing relationships between them, which has allowed simulations to be carried out using System Dynamics (SD) modelling. With information referring to the case Malaga's cruise port (Spain), the results show future scenarios in which the flow of cruise passengers is conditioned both by the effects of COVID-19 and by the tourism and macroeconomic environment. The results also suggest that SD modelling is a tool that can be used to support decision-making in cruise port management by helping to identify strategies that guarantee the sustainability of the system.

It is essential for the port to implement the effective alleviation strategies for handling the uncertain congestion. This paper aims to investigate the performance of the epidemic prevention alliance strategy (EPAS), shared berths strategy (SBS) around adjacent ports and their hybrid strategy in alleviating the port congestion. To simulate the effect of these three strategies, a system dynamics model of dual-port operation is developed considering the factors of the integrated service level of liner routes, empty container allocation, port congestion and regional economics, and so forth. The results indicate that the key issue of port congestion stems from the implementation of epidemic preventive measures. Among these three strategies, the hybrid strategy performs the best in alleviating the port congestion, improving integrated service levels, and curbing the fluctuation of container price. Moreover, the measures of investing more human resources and fixed assets are always taken in many current ports to alleviate the issue of port congestion. Therefore, the impacts of various investment in human resources and fixed assets on alleviating the port congestion are discussed. Finally, some suggestions are provided for the government to strengthen the cooperation between ports and promote the construction of port facility resources.

However, it is challenging to meet the same pricing standards everywhere, particularly for regions located far from the production centres. The government initiated the Motorways of the Sea Program to tackle this issue. Stakeholders in Indonesia’s maritime logistics should be involved in the implementation processes, including the port operators, the shipping industry, and the government as a regulator and infrastructure enabler. However, the democratic, decentralised, and pluralistic nature of Indonesia’s government, culture, and bureaucracy has challenged the implementation of the Motorways of the Sea Program. Based on a systematic map of each stakeholder’s interests, barriers, and expectations, the study used a systems thinking approach to capture the interactions among stakeholders’ activities and policies in the maritime logistics system. A causal loop diagram and a stock and flow diagram were developed to provide a holistic view of the system. Several systemic forces that became the leverages of the system’s performance were identified. The most important factors are infrastructure development, both physical and non-physical infrastructures that include information and communication technology, service procedures, and human capital supporting the service system.

We argue that special port IT capabilities are needed to address these challenges by sharing information and planning and executing container transport in a collaborative way, establishing inter-organizational information architectures, and coordinating interests to successfully implement the technological infrastructures. We focus on the role of port community systems that support port communities in meeting the demands of global supply chains. Port Inter-Organizational Information Systems has a multidisciplinary nature and should be of interest to students, researchers, and practitioners in several fields, including information management, information systems, operations management, supply chain management, and technology management.

This paper explores the use of qualitative system dynamics tools and a participatory modelling approach to support scoping stages of an integrated sustainability assessment (ISA) process. To facilitate mapping of maritime sustainability issues in Portugal, a series of preparatory interviews allowed eliciting stakeholders’ perceptions and their alignment with current public policies. In the subsequent participatory modelling workshop, stakeholders deliberated on maritime problems and constructed causal loop diagrams, identifying feedback structures and voting on leverage points to intervene in the system. Overall results show that the process generated positive outcomes at individual and group levels, stimulating basic systems thinking knowledge and skills. Although further time for model iteration was suggested, the proposed approach promoted learning and a transition toward a shared and more holistic view of maritime problems and its underlying causal interrelationships. This is a promising result for the use of participatory modelling approaches as platforms supporting emerging ISA frameworks.

For the Jiangmen MPA with a fit degree of 0.269, the most prominent motif type is shared single resource access (motif family II, medium fit), characterized by resource competition and no possibilities for substitution. For example, although Sousa chinensis and protected areas provide values for the government, researchers, tourism enterprises and tourists, residents are not connected due to resource competition and non-substitutability. The lack of resident participation undermines the fit degree, hindering more robust and longer-term conservation success (Wu et al., 2021). Involvement and sense of ownership through community-based programs are crucial for effectiveness building of the MPA (Hockings, 2006).

(1) For the Xiamen MPA with fit degree of 0.466, access to one exclusive and one shared resource (motif family V, high fit) is the most pronounced. Social actors such as residents and tourism enterprises experience ecological substitutability with shared access to Sousa chinensis and protected areas, while the government only has access to Sousa chinensis. Although the Xiamen and Pearl River MPAs are praised for locally based MPA programs (Zhu et al., 2021) and benign ecological environments (Bao et al., 2019), the relatively weak connection between the government and protected area itself limits their further advancement of fit degree. For example, illegal sand mining activities in the amphioxus protected areas and overlaps between conflicting functional zones were mentioned in the Xiamen MPA (Hou et al., 2022), and a decreasing trend of sediment load in the Pearl River Basin since the 1980s has also been detected (Wang et al., 2018). Reducing over-intensive sea use activities and alleviating ecological pressures by adjusting functional zones with greater economic stimulation to low-pressure areas are suggested.

For the Leizhou MPA with fit degrees of −0.241, they are characterized by separated social and ecological systems (motif family IV, very low fit), featuring a lack of links between the social and ecological nodes and even completely isolated social actors. Climatic conditions relate to the most social actors in these two MPAs, but Sousa chinensis and the protected area are scarcely related to residents and other actors. This may be attributed to the sheer distance of these MPAs to the coasts and their relatively short establishment time. For fit degree improvement, apart from citizen-involving programs, local authorities are suggested to combine the MPA with tourism activities to create more value and links (Wells et al., 2016).

Empty containers accumulated at specific ports cannot only generate profit but also increase the environmental footprint. This research proposes a Maritime Empty Container Reposition Modelling Framework by integrating the agent-based modelling (ABM) paradigm to model the global movements of empty containers. An agent-based maritime logistic empty container redistribution model was developed to help minimize the total relevant costs for empty container movement in the planning horizon. In the system, ports, shipping companies, customers, and empty containers were identified as critical agents. Using simulated annealing (SA), shipping line agents were able to optimise empty container repositioning to determine the best sequence for moving containers. The model was applied to the Asia–Middle East region to simulate global empty containers repositioning in the region. The results comparison shows that the proposed optimised empty container repositioning framework can significantly reduce the shipping line’s costs and make full use of empty containers.

Due to the socioeconomic and ecological importance of these areas, predicting relevant indicators of the ecosystem state on sub-seasonal to interannual timescales is gaining increasing attention. Depending on the application, forecasts may be sought for variables and indicators spanning physics (e.g., sea level, temperature, currents), chemistry (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, pH), and biology (from viruses to top predators). Many components of the marine ecosystem are known to be influenced by leading modes of climate variability, which provide a physical basis for predictability. However, prediction capabilities remain limited by the lack of a clear understanding of the physical and biological processes involved, as well as by insufficient observations for forecast initialization and verification. The situation is further complicated by the influence of climate change on ocean conditions along coastal areas, including sea level rise, increased stratification, and shoaling of oxygen minimum zones. Observations are thus vital to all aspects of marine forecasting: statistical and/or dynamical model development, forecast initialization, and forecast validation, each of which has different observational requirements, which may be also specific to the study region. Here, we use examples from United States (U.S.) coastal applications to identify and describe the key requirements for an observational network that is needed to facilitate improved process understanding, as well as for sustaining operational ecosystem forecasting. We also describe new holistic observational approaches, e.g., approaches based on acoustics, inspired by Tara Oceans or by landscape ecology, which have the potential to support and expand ecosystem modeling and forecasting activities by bridging global and local observations.

Safety investment is becoming a vital part of port operation in current era in order to overcome different types of hazards the port operation exposed to. This paper aims to improve the safety level of port operation through analyzing its influencing factors and exploring the interactions between the safety investment and system risk level. By analyzing the key factors affecting the port operation and their mutual relationship within a man–machine–environment–management system, a decision-making model of safety investment in port enterprise was established by system dynamics (SD). An illustration example and a sensitivity analysis were carried out to justify and validate the proposed model. The results show that increasing the total safety investment of port enterprises, improving the safety management investment on personnel, and strengthening the implementation effect of investment can improve the degree of port security to a certain extent. The strength of the proposed work is its practical application in current scenarios using real time data and the ability to provide a baseline approach for port enterprises to formulate safety investment strategy.

Due to fishery restrictions, local fishers are struggling with incentives to better relate to the MPA (Martinson, 2021).

Managing container shipping logistics requires people with good competencies, especially in the time of new challenges. The purpose of this paper is to validate a new framework of competencies for container shipping logistics professionals.
Design/methodology/approach
The competency framework was proposed through a comprehensive literature review process followed by in-depth interviews with senior maritime logistics executives both in Singapore and South Korea. It contains three groups of business-, logistics- and management-related competencies, with each group further being classified into generalist and maritime-specific skills and knowledge. A confirmatory survey was also conducted in both countries. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software and thematic analysis technique.
Findings
It was found that all competencies proposed in this framework are important and perceived to contribute to work performance of container shipping logisticians. Findings also revealed that those competencies related to management are more important and can contribute to work performance of container shipping logisticians more than those of logistics and business nature.
Originality/value
The proposed and validated framework is original as it is the first framework for container shipping logisticians. This lays the background for future research on competency-based education and training programs for logisticians in container shipping logistics and other sectors of the maritime supply chain. Findings of this research can help senior management identify important competencies which are critical for container shipping logisticians to acquire, and design subsequent training and education programs accordingly.

There is little research on the systematic impact assessment. This study took Shanghai Port as an example and evaluated the impact under different scenarios through establishing a System Dynamics model. It is found that the epidemic mainly has a greater impact on passenger transport, but less on cargo transport. The ports with the function of transportation in highway, railway, and waterway were the key nodes in the international logistics network. More attention should be paid to the impact assessment of COVID-19 on ports’ production and operation. It is necessary to strengthen the port’s collection and distribution capabilities, improve port production efficiency, and further strengthen port modernization. This research method proposed in this paper can provide a reference for the impact assessment of similar events, and the empirical results can provide a reference for handling the epidemic shock for the port and shipping departments.

In contrast to the traditional spectral analysis (univariate), system dynamics reflect the drivers of the market in both supply and demand side, and therefore, it is a multi-variate system equilibrium approach consisting of various causal spillovers from sub-components of the market. This study is the first to analyze the cycle of container market using system dynamics. By utilizing system dynamics cyclicality approach, one-step ahead predictions are generated for monthly containerized freight index and compared to conventional benchmarks for post-sample validation.

Despite progress in depicting social-ecological interdependency, focus is less on measuring universally applicable and quantitatively comparable fit. By reviewing international marine protected areas' fit problems and transforming qualitative subgraphs to quantitative submatrices, the modified Moran's I can measure social-ecological fit in worldwide scenarios. As an example, results of China's 6 Sousa chinensis marine protected areas include: (1) Quantitative calculations aligned with qualitative motifs, indicating a gradient of fit degrees and motif types; (2) Fit degree was significant at the 95% confidence level after of 10,000 randomizations; (3) Fit degrees could be predicted with over 90% accuracy by common network attributes including betweenness centrality, clustering centrality, degree centrality and eigenvector centrality in 10,000 cross-validations; (4) The development pathway, stages and resilience of fit were presented. Fit problems and solutions were categorized into four groups based on the fit degrees. Governance insights for international practitioners include enhancing access to ecological resources through strengthening connections, avoiding overexploitation of resources via values creation, and following the adaptation-transformation pathway in co-management programs. Without any environmental restrictions and species specifications, the mathematically defined indicator of fit can be applied to other social-ecological systems to offer optimization strategies locally and internationally. For the Nanpeng MPA with fit degrees of −0.269, they are characterized by separated social and ecological systems (motif family IV, very low fit), featuring a lack of links between the social and ecological nodes and even completely isolated social actors. Climatic conditions relate to the most social actors in these two MPAs, but Sousa chinensis and the protected area are scarcely related to residents and other actors. This may be attributed to the sheer distance of these MPAs to the coasts and their relatively short establishment time. For fit degree improvement, apart from citizen-involving programs, local authorities are suggested to combine the MPA with tourism activities to create more value and links (Wells et al., 2016).

Out of all the renewable energy options available, ocean wave energy is very promising because of its accessibility, abundance, and in addition to several possible transduction methods. However, as compared to other kinds of energy harvesting (EH) devices, wave energy harvesters are still not matured in the case of grid integration, mass production, and commercialization. In this paper, we present a brief review of several wave EH mechanisms such as triboelectric, piezoelectric, electromagnetic, etc. to harvest ocean wave energy, their working principle, structure-wise approaches, and the key findings from these devices. The theory of ocean waves, types of ocean wave energy harvesters, and transfer method of wave energy are also discussed in this article. Moreover, for all the mentioned architectures, a comparison table has also been provided where the output performance of several devices is compared. Finally, the study concludes by illustrating the challenges, solutions, and perspectives of these technologies. Therefore, we believe this review article will set the foundation for advancing this research field.

The effective linkage of these characteristics with maritime infrastructure, such as berths, is critical for the enhancement of ship navigation systems. This endeavor is paramount not only as a research focus within maritime information science but also for the progression of intelligent maritime systems. Traditional methodologies have primarily emphasized the analysis of navigational paths of vessels without an extensive consideration of the geographical dynamics between ships and port infrastructure. However, the introduction of knowledge graphs has enabled the integration of disparate data sources, facilitating new insights that propel the development of intelligent maritime systems. This manuscript presents a novel framework using knowledge graph technology for profound analysis of maritime data. Utilizing automatic identification system (AIS) data alongside spatial information from port facilities, the framework forms semantic triplet connections among ships, anchorages, berths, and waterways. This enables the semantic modeling of maritime behaviors, offering precise identification of ships through their diverse semantic information. Moreover, by exploiting the semantic relations between ships and berths, a reverse semantic knowledge graph for berths is constructed, which is specifically tailored to ship type, size, and category. The manuscript critically evaluates a range of graph embedding techniques, dimensionality reduction methods, and classification strategies through experimental frameworks to determine the most efficacious methodologies. The findings reveal that the maritime knowledge graph significantly enhances the semantic understanding of unmanned maritime equipment, thereby improving decision-making capabilities. Additionally, it establishes a semantic foundation for the development of expansive maritime models, illustrating the potential of knowledge graph technology in advancing intelligent maritime systems.

Safety investment is becoming a vital part of port operation in current era in order to overcome different types of hazards the port operation exposed to. This paper aims to improve the safety level of port operation through analyzing its influencing factors and exploring the interactions between the safety investment and system risk level. By analyzing the key factors affecting the port operation and their mutual relationship within a man–machine–environment–management system, a decision-making model of safety investment in port enterprise was established by system dynamics (SD). An illustration example and a sensitivity analysis were carried out to justify and validate the proposed model. The results show that increasing the total safety investment of port enterprises, improving the safety management investment on personnel, and strengthening the implementation effect of investment can improve the degree of port security to a certain extent. The strength of the proposed work is its practical application in current scenarios using real time data and the ability to provide a baseline approach for port enterprises to formulate safety investment strategy.

In the fisheries sector, fishery improvement projects (FIPs) aim to address environmental challenges by leveraging the capacity of industry actors and using value chains to incentivize change. Despite globally rising FIP numbers, the incentive structures behind FIP establishment and the role of internal dynamics remain poorly understood. This paper uses institutional entrepreneurship as an analytical lens to examine the institutional change surrounding the management and trade of the Indonesian blue swimming crab and sheds light on how global market dynamics, local fishery dynamics, and value chain initiatives interact to affect the trajectory towards sustainability over time. We contribute to the institutional entrepreneurship framework by extending it with social-ecological dynamics, different actors’ ability to realize or resist change, and outcomes of institutional change. These additions can improve its explanatory power in relation to sustainability initiatives in fisheries governance and beyond. Our cross-scale historical analysis of the value chain shows not only the entrepreneurship behind the FIP’s establishment, and its institutional interventions, but also why these have been unsuccessful in improving the ecological sustainability of fishers’ and traders’ behavior. This provides valuable empirical grounding to a wider debate about industry leadership and private incentives for sustainability at large and helps disentangle under what conditions such initiatives are more (or less) likely to have intended effects.

However, there is no specific set of indicators for measuring the maritime logistics performance (MLP) as the popular indexes such as the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) or the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) are either too broad to capture the specific performance of maritime logistics, or too narrow to incorporate all the functional areas of MLP. This article addresses this gap and proposes a comprehensive performance measurement model for maritime logistics. The study attributes extensive literature review and experts’ opinions for developing the initial list of indicators. For extracting and validating the principal factors, the study adopts exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and has found nineteen indicators of the MLP. Based on the Eigenvalues, the indicators have been clustered under four principal factors namely- Port Performance, Shipping Connectivity, Hinterland Logistics, and Sustainability and Resilience. The model will be particularly helpful in understanding the functional areas, key performance indicators, and respective measurement scales of maritime logistics. Thus, it helps the policymakers to understand, evaluate, and accelerate the MLP of a country with appropriate policy mechanisms You need to flexibly find nodes from the description, and include social, oceanographic and socio-oceanographic interactions in one single matrix.

Based on the system dynamics method, we construct a carbon abatement model of maritime supply chain, in which the interaction among company, economy, energy, environment, and policy is deeply analysed. The effect of various carbon abatement measures is simulated with a case study of Shanghai Port. The results prove that the shore power has tremendous potential for reducing emissions. Interestingly, the emission trading scheme has little effect on emission reduction. Conversely, it will increase CO2 emissions because of the vicious circle of higher CO2 production and decreased CO2 treatment capability. Case 4 is the best alternative for reducing CO2 emissions in maritime supply chain when combined measures are applied, regardless of the emission reduction effect or carbon emission intensity. Thus, it is most effective to mobilise all kinds of resources to reduce CO2 emissions when conditions permit.

The main objective of this paper is to explore a more holistic approach to modelling options for the difficult task of managing an open access fishery. To this end, a system dynamics model was used to provide a general framework that incorporates several interacting factors that influence the management of the fishery. Such a model, which combines both biological and economic data, is appropriate for fisheries management practise. In this case, three policy scenarios (in addition to a business-as-usual scenario) based on a reduction in the number of boats fishing are used to simulate the behaviour of the stock IM. The results show that the optimal CPUE level is achieved with a 25% reduction in the total number of boats. In this scenario, a biomass of 127,432 metric tonnes IM of adult fish is predicted in 2050, with a catch of 32,884 tonnes for 2698 boats. In comparison, the biomass of IM in 2016 is 112,384 tonnes with a catch of 32,454 tonnes for 4616 boats. Based on these results, we can determine for the first time the optimal level of fishing capacity to ensure the sustainability of the fishery at IM. Overall, this work introduces a new method for simulating Malaysian fisheries data and new modelling methods that are not widely used in the Malaysian fisheries modelling field.

The need for effective restoration tools capable of promoting large-scale recovery of coastal ecosystems in the face of intensifying climatic stress has never been greater. We identify four major challenges for more effective implementation of coastal marine ecosystem restoration (MER): (1) development of effective, scalable restoration methods, (2) incorporation of innovative tools that promote climate adaptation, (3) integration of social and ecological restoration priorities, and (4) promotion of the perception and use of coastal MER as a scientifically credible management approach. Tackling these challenges should improve restoration success rates, heighten their recognition, and accelerate investment in and promotion of coastal MER. To reverse the accelerating decline of marine ecosystems, we discuss potential directions for meeting these challenges by applying coastal MER tools that are science-based and actionable. For coastal restoration to have a global impact, it must incorporate social science, technological and conceptual advances, and plan for future climate scenarios.

Along these lines, a major focus of SME resiliency research has been on examining factors needed to keep an SME open after a disaster. This makes sense as SMEs are critical to community recovery. It seems logical that the severity of a disaster would indicate the impact to a community. Using a systems thinking methodology, we developed a hypothesis that this correlation of severity to impact breaks down over time, causing the community to quickly spiral into trouble. This paper presents an agent-based model to test our hypothesis. The results indicate the impact to a community becomes much more extreme after a threshold or “tipping point” is crossed.

Such communities are more vulnerable to wildfire, flooding, pandemic, natural and human-made hazards because of poverty and, consequently, poor living conditions such as overcrowding and non-understanding of community resilience. The inability of these communities to understand community resilience and withstand adversities affects the sustainability of initiatives to develop them. This study aims to identify the mechanisms influencing the level of understanding of community resilience in a vulnerable community and to contribute to the understanding of community resilience to disaster risk. Fieldwork was conducted in an informal settlement in South Africa. The research study was conducted in two cycles of data collection and analysis. Data in the form of observation notes, document analysis and interviews were analysed using grounded-theory principles. Ten inter-related variables or mechanisms emerged from the analysis. The theoretical model consists of four reinforcing (R) feedback loops (R1, R2, R3 and R4), respectively, which explain how the understanding of community resilience in the informal settlement maps on to the relative achievement systems archetype. Negative reinforcing behaviour would explain the lack of understanding of community resilience, while positive reinforcing behaviour indicates how an understanding of community resilience develops. In addition, the variable with the leverage to improve the mechanisms influencing the understanding of community resilience was found to be the ‘level of public education and awareness’. The theory of how these variables behave in context was represented as a qualitative system dynamics model.

However, none of these ports feature in the world’s top 20. Several studies on port efficiency indicate the need to benchmark the productivity of ports with global standards. Productivity is measured in terms of cargo (in tonnes, or 20-foot equivalent unit, TEU) handled per hour or so. The outcome of enhanced productivity is quicker turnaround time of ships. The productivity of the major Indian ports does not match the global standards. In order to improve their efficiency, the government-managed ports have initiated privatization of their terminals and outsourcing of cargo handling services since 1991. Yet, the ports are lagging behind major ports across the world. A major reason for the inefficiencies of the Indian ports is because of its pricing mechanism and its ability to take proactive decision, especially with regard to capacity enhancement of the terminals. This is so because in major Indian ports, the ship pays for the number of days it stays in the berth. In inefficient ports, ships stay for long duration and as a result the port earns on account of its inefficiencies. These ports fail to recognize the paradox, and as such take corrective action only after ships divert to other ports. Ports projects have long gestation periods. So far, no study encompassing the dimensions port pricing, productivity and efficiency has been undertaken by researchers. In this article we attempt to explore the causes that affect the performance of Indian ports. We present a cause and effect analysis to explain the dynamics arising out of the interactions of productivity, infrastructure, and pricing mechanism of an Indian port system. A system dynamics framework has been used to develop the causal model. Four feedback loops were identified, which explain the governing rules and the paradoxes impacting the performance of Indian ports.

Yet, much research is still needed to fully understand the multi-faceted and complex nature of housing recovery. The goal of this paper is to present a holistic model to further the understanding of the dynamic processes and interdependencies of housing recovery. The impetus for this work is that inequalities in housing recovery could be addressed more effectively if we better understood interconnected factors and dynamic processes that slow down recovery for some. Currently, there is a lack of understanding about such factors and processes. Literature from engineering and social sciences was reviewed to develop an integrated system dynamics model for post-disaster housing recovery. While it is beyond current capabilities to quantify such complexities, the presented model takes a major stride toward articulating the complex phenomenon that is housing recovery.

However, despite its popularity, there has been little progress in moving it from a metaphor to applied projects. While case study research is rich with examples of systems that have proven to be resilient or are striving to develop resilience, the approaches for operationalising concepts described in the literature are still under development. This paper contributes to this development by incorporating system dynamics (SD) modelling within participatory approaches to resilience assessment. With this aim, we combined concepts and practices from the resilience literature with experiences, those documented in the literature and our own, applying system dynamics to resilience assessment. The proposed approach builds and complement other the literature by outlining a modelling process that is consistent with both the resilience literature and the SD modelling practices and providing a generic structure for designing interventions.

Identifying the links to the benefits accrued to society from ecological restoration is of significant importance for achieving successful conservation outcomes and guiding financial investments in ecological restoration. This paper aims to analyze the action mechanism of marine ecological restoration on ecological, economic and social benefits in China. The research hypothesis of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration was first proposed from a theoretical research perspective. On this basis, a structural equation model was employed to validate theoretical assumptions and quantitatively analyze the mechanism of ecological, economic, and social benefits generated by marine ecological restoration in China. We find that marine ecological restoration can improve the level of marine ecosystem services and have a significant positive impact on promoting economic and social development. The results indicate that marine ecological restoration has the greatest impact on social benefits, followed by ecological benefits, and finally on economic benefits, and this result is consistent with the original intention of marine ecological restoration, which aims to directly improve the ecosystem services and social welfare level and indirectly drive economic development.

The improperly disposed domestic refuse has been proven to be a major source of the marine litter, which can be effectively prevented through scientific waste management and citizens' daily pro-environmental behaviour. This study aims to investigates Singapore citizens’ intention of avoiding marine litter based on an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB), incorporating the cognitive constructs as precursors and the irrational constructs as mediators. An online survey was performed targeting Singapore citizens to collect data, and 417 valid responses were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results reveal that environmental knowledge possess significant indirect effect to intention, and concern can act as a predictor of behaviour intention by influencing TPB constructs. Behaviour intention is most influenced by perceived behaviour control, while subjective norm has less constraining force. The irrational factors influence behaviour intention through both direct and indirect paths, habit exerts significant effect to behaviour patterns, while positive affection has greater effect size than negative affection. Previous research regarding marine litter preventing behaviour focus on tourists and consumers, while the survey object of this study is daily behaviour of citizens. The proposed theoretical model extends the traditional TPB by incorporating the cognitive and irrational factors, and offers deeper insights into the process of behaviour change. Besides, the findings also provide implications for government agencies in the field of marine litter control and waste management.

The rate and magnitude of ecological transformations induced by climate change, habitat destruction, overexploitation and pollution are now so substantial that a sixth mass extinction event is currently underway. The biodiversity crisis of the Anthropocene urges scientists to put forward a transformative vision to promote the conservation of biodiversity, and thus indirectly the preservation of ecosystem functions. Here, we identify pressing issues in global change biology research and propose an integrative framework based on multilayer biological networks as a tool to support conservation actions and marine risk assessments in multi-stressor scenarios. Multilayer networks can integrate different levels of environmental and biotic complexity, enabling us to combine information on molecular, physiological and behaviour responses, species interactions and biotic communities. The ultimate aim of this framework is to link human-induced environmental changes to species physiology, fitness, biogeography and ecosystem impacts across vast seascapes and time frames, to help guide solutions to address biodiversity loss and ecological tipping points. Further, we also define our current ability to adopt a widespread use of multilayer networks within ecology, evolution and conservation by providing examples of case-studies. We also assess which approaches are ready to be transferred and which ones require further development before use. We conclude that multilayer biological networks will be crucial to inform (using reliable multi-levels integrative indicators) stakeholders and support their decision-making concerning the sustainable use of resources and marine conservation.

These linkages can affect trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Understanding these linkages, by considering multiple ecosystem services simultaneously supports management of the environment and sustainable use of resources. The UK marine environment is relatively data rich, yet the links between ecosystem and several ecosystem services and linkages between services are poorly described. A workshop with 35 marine scientists was used to create a conceptual model that links ecosystem components and key processes to four services they provide and to highlight trade-offs between them. The model was subsequently further developed to include pressures and mitigating management measures. The models are discussed in terms of their application to marine data to facilitate evidence-based marine management and their usefulness to communicate management measures with managers and stakeholders.

Models are needed that incorporate dynamic processes within coupled economic and physical systems for decision-makers, including when to retreat from hazardous areas. This paper presents a coupled geo-economic model of beach width and property value with exogenous sea level rise. Discrete dynamic programming identifies optimal beach nourishment and managed retreat strategies. As a new contribution, we treat expected damages as costs, which demonstrates that increased damage offsets some benefits of development along hazardous coastlines. The model identifies managed retreat as preferable to beach nourishment when damages exceed a threshold. Regret associated with retreat depends on sea level rise damages and the timeframe of analysis. Considering dynamic complexity of coastal systems, as this model does, may produce climate adaptation plans that better address community needs and reduce risk over timescales of interest.

Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most deployed technologies, due to its electrical energy efficiency and comparatively low costs. However, the required energy for desalination processes is often still converted from fossil sources. Given the growing demand for seawater desalination and the energy sector’s parallel decarbonization, the substitution by renewable energy sources (RES) is a critical issue. The volatility, lower availability of renewable energy, and cost for required electrical energy storage (EES) are all obstacles to the decarbonization of large-scale desalination plants and may affect production volume and water production costs negatively.
This paper presents a mathematical model to determine a cost-optimal energy conversion and EES mix for the design and operation of large-scale seawater RO desalination plants. The linear program ensures satisfaction of the plant’s energetic demands. Furthermore, the model allows to investigate the general feasibility of integrating RES into large-scale desalination processes, which are examined by means of a case study while employing location-specific weather data. Different types of energy conversion technologies and the effect of EES on operating behavior, greenhouse gas emissions, and water unit costs are investigated. Specifically, the indirect storage of electrical energy via the smart management of a desalination plant’s oversized RO membranes is examined and compared to battery energy storage (BES).
Results indicate that RES cannot meet an RO desalination plant’s full and constant electrical load demand without a high BES capacity, which is probably not feasible from a technical and economic point of view. The economic penalty from energy storage costs on one unit of desalinated water ranges from 3.10 $/m3 up to 5.38 $/m3. However, operating an oversized RO desalination plant intermittently could reduce the energy-related costs substantially and potentially provide a more appropriate way of adapting to a volatile supply of energy from renewable sources in order to decarbonize the desalination processes. Specific emissions of desalinated water can be reduced from 1.5 kg CO2 eq./m3 when relying mostly on combined cycle gas turbines down to 0.124 kg CO2 eq./m3 by intermittent operation and fully relying on renewable energy sources.

The general public is mostly unaware of their existence, but the consequences of failure are significant. The most common cause of failure of such pipelines is from third-party activities, particularly excavation around a pipeline. As a result, urban expansion to accommodate growing cities in historically rural areas containing high-pressure pipelines poses a significant risk given that a pipeline rupture and fire can cause multiple fatalities over a significant area. Currently, this risk is managed with varying degrees of success, with competing stakeholder needs and conflicts in regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions resulting in a lack of awareness of risk, or responsibility shifting between stakeholders. In worst cases, homes and infrastructure have been built in close proximity to pipelines with no prior consultation with relevant experts. This paper uses a systems approach to understand the effects of regulatory frameworks on practices in three case study sites, two in Australia and one in the UK, that manage development around pipelines in different ways. The comparative case studies, informed by interview data with stakeholders and a desktop analysis of regulation and policy, highlight how the different regulatory processes within the three governance systems shape different outcomes in stakeholder practices and pipeline safety and community amenity. A systems approach to evaluation sheds light on the limitations of some reductionist efforts to address the issue by stakeholders and highlights more systemic opportunities for regulatory reform.

The objective of this study was to develop a conceptual framework that could be used to answer stakeholder questions about oil spill impacts and to identify knowledge gaps and future integration priorities. The framework was initially separated into four knowledge domains (ocean environment, biological ecosystems, socioeconomics, and human health) whose interactions were explored by gathering stakeholder questions through public engagement, assimilating expert input about existing models, and consolidating information through a system dynamics approach. This synthesis resulted in a causal loop diagram from which the interconnectivity of the system could be visualized. Results of this analysis indicate that the system naturally separates into two tiers, ocean environment and biological ecosystems versus socioeconomics and human health. As a result, ocean environment and ecosystem models could be used to provide input to explore human health and socioeconomic variables in hypothetical scenarios. At decadal-plus time scales, the analysis emphasized that human domains influence the natural domains through changes in oil-spill related laws and regulations. Although data gaps were identified in all four model domains, the socioeconomics and human health domains are the least established. Considerable future work is needed to address research gaps and to create fully coupled quantitative integrative assessment models that can be used in strategic decision-making that will optimize recoveries from future large oil spills.

Prior studies primarily focused on reducing risk through reinforcement of supply-side reliability. However, during or after a disaster, electricity demand is likely to vary (e.g., electricity use may increase for disaster relief supply production or decrease because of governmental energy conservation policies). This study examined the impact of demand-side responses from industrial, commercial, and residential sectors on the performance of the power grid when supply shortages occur after earthquakes. Electricity supply and demand in the context of seismic hazards were modeled based on the system dynamics approach, and the model was tested with seismic hazards that occurred in South Korea in 2016. The simulation results showed that without supply growth after seismic hazards, the blackout decreased as much as 6.7% of daily electricity use in the case region when commercial and residential sectors give positive aid for participating in mandatory or voluntary demand control, or both. This finding demonstrates the critical role of demand-side management, which can regulate electricity consumption to improve community resilience. The outcomes of this research have the potential to support governmental policymaking to determine optimal values of generation capacity expansion, load shedding, and voluntary savings to prevent supply shortages and oversupply.

The extent to which an impacted area recovers from such losses depends in large part on the decision making of local residents. In this study we utilize scenario simulation, a methodology that uses video simulation of a news report to immerse respondents in the details and consequences of a biological terrorist attack. Specifically, we explore the decision-making of local residents to a large-scale terrorist attack using weaponized anthrax in the Seattle, Washington area. The scenario was based on one of the U.S. Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s National Planning Scenarios. This study focuses on structuring a decision model around the objectives and motivations that shape local residentsâ€™ decisions to act during recovery from an anthrax attack. The relevant uncertainties and objectives that drive residentsâ€™ decisions during response and recovery from the anthrax attack were developed using live group scenario simulations with various stakeholders in Seattle. In the beginning stages of the crisis concerns about health predominate. Later concerns about financial security emerge. Throughout it appears that residents weigh their concerns for safety with the collective costs of leaving the Seattle area. The decision model produces several key insights that are critical to the development and implementation of recovery policies.

Whereas great strides have been made over the last several decades at moving toward ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM), largely through the development of integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs), the inclusion of human dimensions into these efforts has often been fragmentary and, in juxtaposition to the biophysical dynamics, sometimes even seemingly superficial. This presents a great challenge to the accuracy and applicability of these results, as the lack of appropriate incorporation of humans can be problematic in terms of both social and biophysical consequences. This study systematically documents current social science understanding of the multiple human dimensions that should be incorporated within ecosystem assessments and the overall approach to each of these within IEAs and other EBFM efforts. These dimensions include the multi-faceted nature of human well-being, heterogeneity in human well-being derived from fisheries, adaptive behaviors, and cumulative effects. The systematic inclusion of these dimensions into IEAs is then laid out in a conceptual framework that details how a perturbation reverberates through a fisheries system and the iterative approach that should be undertaken to understand its impacts on human dimensions. This framework is supplemented with a data collection scheme that is intended to facilitate operationalization. The detailed examination of incorporating human dimensions within IEAs presented in this study should further resonate with other ecosystem assessment efforts, providing not just ample evidence of the need for moving beyond simplistic assumptions of human homogeneity but a means of systematically integrating a more realistic and representative perspective.

A number of modelling studies have used system dynamic models to represent the complex dynamics generated by the interplays between the social and physical systems. Yet, attitudes towards drought and flood risk leading to the implementation of individual and collective adaptation measures are not included in current system dynamics modelling approaches. To address this gap, we developed a system dynamic model to represent the dynamics between human societies, decision-making processes, adaptation measures, and hydrological extremes. The model accounts for a society characterized by the co-existence of four types of risk attitudes and management responses: risk-neglecting, risk-controlling, risk-downplaying, and risk-monitoring. Our findings show that the presence of a prevalent social group with a certain risk attitude has a strong influence on the awareness, preparedness, and consequent losses of the other social groups. On the other hand, the homogenous presence of social groups with diverse risk attitudes leads to higher drought and flood losses due to the unsustainable water use of risk-neglecting and risk-downplaying groups. Finally, our results highlight that societies characterized by high heterogeneity in risk-attitudes tend to implement less collective measures, opting instead for individual measures by specific social groups. This emphasizes the importance of accounting for different social groups when modelling human-water dynamics to promote an integrated risk management and design more sustainable and resilient future adaptation pathways.

The influence of trans-situational and situation-specific variables on self-assessed and factual knowledge among coastal residents and commercial marine stakeholders. Data were collected using a questionnaire based survey administered to a random sample of coastal residents and commercial marine stakeholders in eight communities in central California. Knowledge of biological features was higher than knowledge of physical and chemical processes. Both trans-situational and situation-specific variables were significant predictors of knowledge, in particular gender, education, and ocean use patterns. TV and social media were the only information sources that correlated negatively with knowledge. Predictors for distinct types of knowledge were different and provide insights that could help target specific ocean literacy gaps. The study also finds that commercial marine stakeholders were more knowledgeable than other coastal residents. Having an economic stake in the marine environment appears to be a strong motivation to be more educated about the ocean.

Despite the retreating Arctic Sea ice cover, seasonal shipping along the NSR requires icebreaker support and the utilisation of ice-class ships. To support operational and fleet investment decisions, we analyse the supply dynamics of cargo shipping and icebreaker capacity in the event of growing cargo volumes along the NSR through a system dynamics model till year 2065. In the model, the initial tonnage is based on existing fleet, while hypothetical cargo growth assumes three levels (low, medium and high), and climatic conditions follow three alternative scenarios (melting, baseline and freezing). The model results indicate that over 30 million tonnes of cargo p.a. would be needed to maintain a sustainable level of traffic in the NSR, compared to less than 4 million tonnes in 2014. During the modelled 50-year-period, on average 24 to 44 per cent of potential NSR cargo volume will be lost due to ageing icebreakers and ice-classed fleets and the slow newbuilding pace. The findings suggest that NSR’s economic potential for global shipping is likely to remain marginal for decades to come because of its inherent constraints.

We identified linkages in a case study of the Lake St. Clair (LSC) region, part of the Laurentian Great Lakes system. Our research phases included: (1) investigating and revising existing coupled human and natural systems frameworks to develop a framework for this case study; (2) testing and refining the framework by hosting a 1-day stakeholder workshop and (3) creating a causal loop diagram (CLD) to illustrate the relationships among the systems' key components. With stakeholder assistance, we identified four interrelated pathways that include water use and discharge, land use, tourism and shipping that impact the ecological condition of LSC. The interrelationships between the pathways of water use and tourism are further illustrated by a CLD with several feedback loops. We suggest that this holistic approach can be applied to other case studies and inspire the development of dynamic models capable of informing decision making for sustainability.

Exploring the dynamics and driving mechanisms of resort SES at different stages is beneficial for understanding urban adaption to future pressure, creating elaborate strategies for tourism innovation, and achieving sustainable resort development. Therefore, this study proposed the Adaptive-TALC model as a novel analytical framework for resort evolution, using Qinhuangdao Resort as an empirical case study. The results revealed that 1) from 1979 to 2023, Qinhuangdao tourism resort had been gradually transformed from a simple socioecological system based on natural resource utilization to a complex adaptive system integrating natural and human resource utilization, 2) governance systems played a pivotal role in resort evolution, and business utilized digital technology to innovate resort products, thereby accelerating system renewal and reorganisation, and 3) within the context of panarchy, Aranya's holiday products serve as a model for local businesses to improve and innovate their products and ultimately promote Qinhuangdao's sustainable development. This study contributes to theories of tourist destination evolution by providing a novel framework for the cognition of the tourism resource sustainable utilization in resorts and provides insights into innovative approaches such as nature-cultural hybrid solutions, adaptive urban planning, and digital tourism, enabling tourism cities to enhance their adaption and mitigate potential risks.

Sustainable management system is needed to increase the production of tuna processing industry by still preserving its sustainability. This problem became more complex, due to the dynamic nature of ecosystems and other processes involved. This study developed a system dynamics model which integrates tuna stocks ecosystem, tuna processing industry development, social economic, and policy sub-models. This model was developed based on historical data, then developed into three development scenarios: without fish-catch limitation, limitation by Sustainable Maximum yield (MSY) and limitation by Maximum economic yield (MEY). System dynamic modeling was conducted to analyze sustainable tuna industry development based on various points of view, to accommodate stakeholder interest. The success of tuna processing industry development, were assessed from the increase of production values, the preservation of tuna and tuna-like fish stock in the environment, and also the improvement of social welfare. Simulations were carried out for 25 years to predict the condition of fish stocks in the future, based on current policies applied. Simulation results show that to develop tuna processing industry while maintaining the stock of tuna in its sustainable conditions, only limiting the fish catch was not enough, the process of integrating industry, socioeconomic and policy made by related institutions were also important.

To address this gap, this study uses a panel vector autoregressive model to further explore the interactions between marine economic growth, marine pollution, and urbanization in 11 Chinese coastal provinces/municipalities from 2000 to 2016. The per capita gross ocean product (GOP) and the per capita volume of industrial wastewater discharged directly into the sea decreased during the research period, whereas the urbanization rate increased. The spatial pattern of the main polluted areas showed a shift from north to south. Marine economic growth had a single-direction influence on marine pollution and urbanization in coastal regions, implying that urban expansion did not increase the ocean output. Consistent with previous findings, urban expansion aggravated environmental damage to the ocean. According to both impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, urbanization had a significant role in explaining variation in the three factors examined in this study. In addition, according to heterogeneity analysis, the three factors were most affected in the mid-income regions and southern coastal areas, while the areas with more developed marine services could better resist the negative effects of marine pollution and urban expansion. The policy implications of increasing the proportion of the marine economy and of controlling the acceleration of urbanization are explored.

Existing knowledge regarding the diffusion of recovery in community socio-spatial networks, however, is rather limited. To bridge this gap, we created a network diffusion model to characterize the unfolding of population activity recovery in spatial networks of communities. In particular, this study aims to answer the research question “To what extent can the diffusion model capture the spatial patterns of recovery?” Using population activity recovery data derived from location-based information associated with 2017 Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area, we parameterized the threshold-based network diffusion model using the genetic algorithm and then simulated the recovery diffusion process. The results show that the spatial effects of recovery are rather heterogeneous across different areas; some spatial areas demonstrate a greater spatial effect in their recovery. Also, the results show that low-income and minority areas are community recovery multipliers; with faster recovery in these areas corresponding to accelerated recovery for the entire community. Hence, prioritizing these areas in resource allocation during recovery has the potential to accelerate could expedite the recovery of the entire community’s recovery process while promoting recovery equality and equity.

The convention requires all ships, including existing ones, to have a Ballast Water Treatment System (BWTS) onboard before September 8, 2024. There are some concerns about the compliance costs of BWMC, especially the additional cost of retrofitting cases. The ship retrofitting cost will depend on various factors, and it can be difficult for a shipowner to determine accurately. The procedure is intricate, and there are many factors to consider, such as the ship's size, BWTS system complexity, and the price of materials and modification level. In this paper, A proposed approach involves expert judgment to capture the effect of multi-stakeholder and estimate the compliance cost. As an essential part of the research methodology, the system dynamics method and life cycle cost are combined to develop a compliance cost model during the ship's lifetime. The simulation model shows that the confidence level of retrofitting costs for each BWTS is more than 94%. Therefore, the model can be used to estimate additional costs. As a result, BWTS type A is the most economical system for small tankers, with an estimated cost of USD 802,860 for the remaining 12 years of the ship's lifetime. Shipowners can use this model as a supporting decision tool to determine which BWTS would be suitable and assist in determining the budget necessary to comply with the BWMC.

Since societies are constantly exposed to various natural disasters like earthquakes, many precautions must be taken both before and after a disaster to minimize the damage. Seismic resilience is one of the practical assessments that may be taken in this regard. Quantifying the functionality of seismic resilience requires a systematic examination of the relevant components and their functional impact. We present a framework based on fragility, consequence and recoverability stages for evaluating the impact of a component on its functionality for earthquake events. Within this study, we introduce a novel set of indicators, which are derived from the key variables impacted by earthquakes, including hospitals, grids, and infrastructures. To that end, we have developed a system dynamics (SD) model to assess earthquake resilience in the context of Society 5.0, considering three earthquake magnitudes (7, 8, and 9 Mw) to simulate societal seismic resilience. We also perform sensitivity analysis to validate the outcomes of the policy simulations. Our findings affirm that by scrutinizing the seismic resilience of critical infrastructure and proposing relevant policies, it is possible to minimize disaster-related damage. This represents a pragmatic step forward in the field of disaster risk management.

Scientific publications often influence evolving policies and inform the public, but sometimes contain errors. The prevalence of papers conveying unjustified messages and with potential to influence public perceptions and policies is concerning. This paper focuses on marine examples that have led to exaggeration of negative impacts on ecosystems, particularly from fisheries, but the criticisms and recommendations also apply more generally. Examples are given of papers on high profile topics that used flawed assumptions or methods, leading to some misleading findings. All examples were eventually followed by published rebuttals. Such papers, often accompanied by media campaigns, can lead to inappropriate policy choices, and other negative outcomes. Science is eventually self-correcting but often too slowly to prevent flawed perceptions and policies. Problems should be corrected before publication. A common weakness in the publication process is inadequate peer-review. Shortcomings at the level of editor can also contribute to the failures. Pressure on scientists to publish, leading to increasing numbers of papers, puts reviewers under more pressure and makes it harder for editors to find suitable ones. Recommendations to avoid the impact of flawed science on policies are made within the framework of a three-legged stool consisting of: (1) scientists who strive for objectivity and accuracy; (2) journals with editors and referees better equipped to guard against unreliable scientific publications; and (3) transparent and inclusive scientific processes to formulate advice on policies and their implementation.

It is estimated that the weight of plastic waste in the oceans will exceed that of fish by 2050. Since a large part of marine debris originate from land-based domestic waste, developing relevant policies to manage the disposal of domestic garbage can effectively prevent and control marine litter pollution. Public attitudes toward relevant environmental policies will affect their implementation and final outcomes. However, there is little research on public attitudes toward environmental policies. Therefore, this study draws on the framework of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explore the factors that affect public attitudes toward policy, the affect theory, trust theory and habit are integrated into the model. An online survey for Singaporean residents was conducted, 450 questionnaires were collected and 417 of which were used for data analysis. The results suggest that 13 of the 14 hypotheses presented in the model are accepted. Perceived ease of implementation (β = 0.365), perceived policy effectiveness (β = 0.341) and trust in government policy (β = 0.319) are the main factors that directly affect citizens' attitude toward environmental policy. Perceived policy effectiveness is positively affected by the perceived ease of implementation (β = 0.457), while trust in government policies is positively influenced by both perceived ease of implementation (β = 0.142) and perceived policy effectiveness (β = 0.373). The model showed good explanatory power, explaining 74.6 % of the variance in public attitude toward policy. In this study, a relatively complete model for predicting public acceptance of marine litter prevention policies is proposed for the first time.

In this study, we developed a simulation model based on statistical and survey data to examine the effectiveness of multi-agent collaborative governance in marine eco-economic systems. Using the data simulation function of system dynamics (SD) Vensim PLE, we verified the input parameters, income variables, behavior probability, and governance outcomes for five types of stakeholders in marine governance, finding that: (1) In a multi-agent the governance framework, arbitrarily increasing the participation probability of one stakeholder type tends to lead to the involvement of two or more types. This leads to the establishment of a compact multi-agent collaborative governance model, significantly enhancing both participation and fairness of governance compared to the traditional government-centric model. (2) Regardless of which parameter is optimized, the multi-agent collaborative governance model can improve the performance of marine eco-economic systems. This governance model is more conducive to the coordinated, healthy, and sustainable development of marine eco-economic system. (3) By calculating the degree of alignment between stakeholders (central government, local government, sea-related producers, sea-related consumers, and coastal communities) across 11 coastal provinces and cities in China, this study identified one or more types of multi-agent collaborative governance models, proving the feasibility of this approach. (4) While collaborative governance models led by five different entities have their unique advantages and disadvantages, further strengthening relationships and cooperation among these stakeholders is essential for advancing the maturity and effectiveness of the multi-agent governance model.

In the current investigation, systems thinking analysis is adopted to understand the deleterious effects of chromium on the environment. Hazardous chromate ions are effectively been remediated from industrial discharges by employing the robust adsorbent prepared from marine algae, Gracilaria Rhodophyta Biochar. The combined effect of physicochemical factors such as contact time, pH, biochar dosage and initial chromate concentration on adsorption performance is analyzed by adopting the statistical Response Surface Methodology. At the optimum operating conditions of pH: 2–4; GRB dosage: 0.3 g/100 mL; contact time: 90 min; initial chromate concentration: 60 mg/L and temperature: 30 °C ± 2, an amount of 19.6 mg/g of chromate ions are removed by the developed adsorbent. The characterization results showcased the efficiency of biochar towards the adsorption of chromate ions from wastewater. The adsorption phenomenon follows the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order rate kinetics. The investigation of selectivity reveals that the developed adsorbent has a good selectivity for Cr(VI) even with the presence of competing ions in the same medium. The developed robust technology can be successfully applied for the adsorption of toxic chromate ions from contaminated industrial samples.

Although the protection reduces the area available for fishing, it has been argued that the spillover effect can increase resources in the adjoining areas. The purpose of this study is to calculate the value of the provision of fishing resources resulting from an increase in the system of marine protected areas in Colombia. To do that, a surplus-production based dynamic bio-economic model is developed for white shrimp (Litopenaeus occidentalis), a species important socially and economically in Colombia. The model includes a protected area with essential habitats, a nonprotected area, and mobility of species between them. Changes in biomass, catch, effort and the economic benefits of fishing through time, under different protection scenarios, are analyzed. Despite the reduction of the area available for fishing, in the mid-term, the protected areas generate increased levels of biomass and greater benefits associated to the fishing activity, because of the spillover effect. In that sense, the marine protected areas constitute a valid alternative for fishery conservation with the potential to generate economic benefits in the midterm.

Based on the contingent valuation method, this paper shows that residents show the strongest preference for short-term management policy, followed by a mix of short- and long-term policy and long-term policy. Residents have the highest willingness to pay for the policy to govern debris in seafloor, followed by in beach and sea surface. Additionally, the theory of planned behavior is introduced into the regression model, and the results show that both behavioral attitude and subjective norms can significantly promote residents’ willingness to pay for marine debris governance.

In the fisheries sector, fishery improvement projects (FIPs) aim to address environmental challenges by leveraging the capacity of industry actors and using value chains to incentivize change. Despite globally rising FIP numbers, the incentive structures behind FIP establishment and the role of internal dynamics remain poorly understood. This paper uses institutional entrepreneurship as an analytical lens to examine the institutional change surrounding the management and trade of the Indonesian blue swimming crab and sheds light on how global market dynamics, local fishery dynamics, and value chain initiatives interact to affect the trajectory towards sustainability over time. We contribute to the institutional entrepreneurship framework by extending it with social-ecological dynamics, different actors’ ability to realize or resist change, and outcomes of institutional change. These additions can improve its explanatory power in relation to sustainability initiatives in fisheries governance and beyond. Our cross-scale historical analysis of the value chain shows not only the entrepreneurship behind the FIP’s establishment, and its institutional interventions, but also why these have been unsuccessful in improving the ecological sustainability of fishers’ and traders’ behavior. This provides valuable empirical grounding to a wider debate about industry leadership and private incentives for sustainability at large and helps disentangle under what conditions such initiatives are more (or less) likely to have intended effects.

Climate change implications in these complex systems are projected to extend from morphological to ecological and socio-economic ones, threatening ecosystems, cultural heritage, settlements, infrastructure and human life itself. Accordingly, the design of protection and adaptation measures that will enhance resilience against relevant hazards has emerged as an imperative need in both research and policy. Understanding how watershed and coastal processes are intertwined into a web of dependencies that shape morphology evolution, how climate change would affect watershed/coastal dynamics and how scientists can design effective protection/adaptation measures, can only be achieved on the basis of integrated modelling systems that simulate the morphodynamics of the watershed-coast continuum. Within this context, the present work provides a critical review of the theoretical background and state-of-the-art of research on the modelling of Watershed-Coast System morphodynamics, and through this: (a) presents a scheme for the integrated modelling of Watershed-Coast System morphodynamics in a changing climate and analyses its core aspects, (b) proposes a methodological framework for adapting integrated modelling approaches for management and engineering purposes, (c) identifies and evaluates the major scientific and modelling challenges ahead, and (d) systematises the path towards informed decision-making for building resilient Watershed-Coast Systems by bridging the gaps between science, society and governance.

Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to ‘road test’ management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem‐based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade‐offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions.

Whereas great strides have been made over the last several decades at moving toward ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM), largely through the development of integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs), the inclusion of human dimensions into these efforts has often been fragmentary and, in juxtaposition to the biophysical dynamics, sometimes even seemingly superficial. This presents a great challenge to the accuracy and applicability of these results, as the lack of appropriate incorporation of humans can be problematic in terms of both social and biophysical consequences. This study systematically documents current social science understanding of the multiple human dimensions that should be incorporated within ecosystem assessments and the overall approach to each of these within IEAs and other EBFM efforts. These dimensions include the multi-faceted nature of human well-being, heterogeneity in human well-being derived from fisheries, adaptive behaviors, and cumulative effects. The systematic inclusion of these dimensions into IEAs is then laid out in a conceptual framework that details how a perturbation reverberates through a fisheries system and the iterative approach that should be undertaken to understand its impacts on human dimensions. This framework is supplemented with a data collection scheme that is intended to facilitate operationalization. The detailed examination of incorporating human dimensions within IEAs presented in this study should further resonate with other ecosystem assessment efforts, providing not just ample evidence of the need for moving beyond simplistic assumptions of human homogeneity but a means of systematically integrating a more realistic and representative perspective.

This paper corresponds the shipping cycle to the shipping market demand situation during the epidemic, incorporates the shipping cycle characteristics and government quota characteristics into a multi-stage evolutionary game model. Later, the study analyzes the equilibrium points of the game parties at each stage and finally investigates the influence of factors such as technological improvement on the strategy choice of shipping enterprises through sensitivity analysis. The study found that the government’s carbon quota policy is influenced by shipping market demand. During the peak shipping season, the government’s quota policy is binding on shipping enterprises. In the low season of shipping, the binding effect of government’s quota policy on shipping enterprises will be reduced, or even appear to be invalid. Therefore, the government should forecast the demand situation of the shipping market, gradually relax the regulation during the peak season of shipping, and strengthen the regulation before the low season of shipping. Shipping enterprises should increase the research and development of carbon emission reduction technology to reduce carbon emissions from the root to realize the sustainable development of ports and marine-related industries in the post-epidemic era.

However, climate variability and anthropogenic climate change may seriously impact small-scale fisheries by altering the abundance and distribution of target species. Social relationships between fishery users, such as fish traders, can determine how each individual responds and is affected by changes in fisheries. These informal cooperative and competitive relationships provide access, support, and incentives for fishing and affect the distribution of benefits. Yet, individuals’ actions and impacts on individuals are often the primary focus of the economic analyses informing small-scale fisheries’ formal management. This focus dismisses relevant social relationships. We argue that this leads to a disconnect between reality and its model representation used in formal management, which may reduce formal fisheries management’s efficiency and efficacy and potentially trigger adverse consequences. Here, we examine this argument by comparing the predictions of a simple bioeconomic fishery model with those of a social-ecological model that incorporates the dynamics of cooperative relationships between fish traders. We illustrate model outcomes using an empirical case study in the Mexican Humboldt squid fishery. We find that (1) the social-ecological model with relationship dynamics substantially improves accuracy in predicting observed fishery variables to the simple bioeconomic model. (2) Income inequality outcomes are associated with changes in cooperative trade relationships. When environmental temperature is included in the model as a driver of species production dynamics, we find that climate-driven temperature variability drives a decline in catch that, in turn, reduce fishers’ income. We observe an offset of this loss in income by including cooperative relationships between fish traders (oligopoly) in the model. These relationships break down following species distribution changes and result in an increase in prices fishers receive. Finally, (3) our social-ecological model simulations show that the current fishery development program, which seeks to increase fishers’ income through an increase in domestic market demand, is supported by predictions from the simple bioeconomic model, may increase income inequality between fishers and traders. Our findings highlight the real and urgent need to re-think fisheries management models in the context of small-scale fisheries and climate change worldwide to encompass social relationship dynamics.

This paper aims to synthesize and review all the literature regarding the topic in a systematic manner to eliminate the bias and provide an overall insight, while incorporating some statistical analysis to provide an interval estimate of these studies. This paper addressed the effect of the positive and negative impacts reported in the literature in two categories of AVs: partial automation and full automation. The positive impacts represented in AVs’ possibility to reduce GHG emission can be attributed to some factors, including eco-driving, eco traffic signal, platooning, and less hunting for parking. The increase in vehicle mile travel (VMT) due to (i) modal shift to AVs by captive passengers, including elderly and disabled people and (ii) easier travel compared to other modes will contribute to raising the GHG emissions. The result shows that eco-driving and platooning have the most significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 35%. On the other side, easier travel and faster travel significantly contribute to the increase of GHG emissions by 41.24%. Study findings reveal that the positive emission changes may not be realized at a lower AV penetration rate, where the maximum emission reduction might take place within 60–80% of AV penetration into the network.

In a practical realm, solid waste problem in Surabaya recently threatens the quality of environment and health of the people. This fact is worsened by the improper solid waste management system and the people neglect. Meanwhile, high economic orientation has seized the concern of government and also people of Surabaya for years. This economic mindset carries away the initiative of sustainable development by putting aside environmental challenges and giving more preference on the trade expansion. Consequently, the economic development perspective remains complex problems on the environmental preservation, particularly the solid waste problem. The enormous population in Surabaya has contributed to the overcrowded solid waste volume that reached a thousand ton per day. This severe situation does require a serious action from local government of Surabaya jointly works with supporting stakeholders (community, Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) and donor). Besides that, a systematic arrangement of solid waste management scenario is also preferred to be developed by conducting a depth research and analysis. Hence, a breakthrough scenario planning is necessary to formulate by developing system dynamic analysis. This tool of analysis is part of hard system methodology from systems thinking framework. According to system dynamic analysis, community participation is assessed to be very effective alternative for the future solid waste management system. A gender emancipation and pro poor based solid waste management system may be built to mitigate negative impacts of solid waste problem. Women and scavenger development may also give solution for both environmental sustainability and economic matter. Further, government may open a wide space for community participation as a willing to provide a better life both for the environment and the people.

Geochemistry plays a central role, from the processes that accumulate elements into ore bodies, to developing exploration techniques that are used to find them. Geochemistry is also important for the processes that win the resources and redistribute them with the accompanying risks of environmental contamination and threats for human health. As geochemists, it is useful to take a step back and look at the big picture of resources from a global perspective, to consider their place in history and to contemplate their importance. The future of our civilisation depends on their wise use and geochemistry lies at the centre – for ensuring adequate supplies and for minimising the risk of poisoning ourselves. This Perspective summarises the current and future availability of many natural resources. But the main focus is on the most important metals and on phosphorus. The metals are grouped into the big six (iron, chromium, manganese, aluminium, copper and zinc), with some shorter discussion of precious (gold, silver and platinum group metals) and other metals. These other metals are those needed for steel (niobium, vanadium, nickel, molybdenum), for technology (tantalum, zircon, indium, gallium, germanium), for new technological developments in the renewable energy industry (europium, terbium, neodynium, lithium), and the chemical industry (platinum group metals, cobalt and rare earth elements).
 
The sobering common aspect for all of these resources is, that available data suggests that their production has either peaked already or will peak within the next 50 years. Throughout history, the major part of the economy of the world´s nations has been driven directly or indirectly by access to and use of natural resources, and this still remains so. Our main findings are that the world is heading towards a restricted access to the key resources that are used by humanity today and these restrictions will have a profound impact on the world economies and life styles of future generations. The challenge is to accept this knowledge, and to find the necessary solutions and adaptions for the future while we still have time and possibility to so. History will judge how well we responded to current resource challenges.

To integrate the concept of low-carbon and green development into the whole process of marine fishery development, it is necessary to comprehend the status quo and development trend of marine fishery carbon emission. This study measures the carbon emissions of marine fisheries in the Northern Marine Economic Circle, a development region representing China’s marine fisheries, from 2006 to 2019. We employed a system dynamics approach to establish a marine fisheries carbon emission dynamic model. In our model, five scenarios are set up to dynamically simulate the development and evolution trend of future marine fisheries carbon emissions, under the impact of rapid economic development, energy structure adjustment, and industrial structure adjustment. The results are as follows. (i) Total carbon emissions from marine fisheries in the northern marine economic zone show a year-on-year increase from 2006 to 2019. (ii) Simulations from the five scenarios indicate that rapid economic development significantly impact the increase of carbon emissions from marine fisheries, while adjustment of the energy and industrial structures helped control carbon emissions from marine fisheries. This study provides relevant information to control carbon emissions at the marine level, and predicts the development trend of carbon emissions from marine fisheries, which can provide a reference for fisheries to seek an effective path of energy conservation and emission reduction, and improve their high-quality development level.

Previous research suggests that different dimensions of perceived risk, trust, and control interact in complex ways to affect inter-organizational collaborative performance, providing an administrative ‘architecture’ that enables partners to share resources, engage in teamwork, resolve conflict, and coordinate tasks and responsibilities while also allaying their concerns about the alliance. However, the extent to which different control mechanisms influence trust and mitigate the perceived risks of collaboration between the diverse organizations involved in transboundary fisheries management remains unclear. This paper presents the quantitative results of survey research conducted in the Salish Sea of North America, an ecosystem spanning the Canada-US border between British Columbia and Washington State. The survey instrument operationalizes a multi-dimensional trust-control-risk framework considered suitable for studying inter-organizational natural resource management (NRM) networks. The findings support descriptions of the Salish Sea as having fewer nation-to-nation governing bodies resulting in a lack of effective formal controls, high perceived regulatory risk, and low procedural trust attributes that can negatively affect the collaborative performance of the fishery management network. This study represents the first quantitative analysis of the complex relationships between different inter-organizational management strategies, trust dimensions, and perceived risks in transboundary fisheries governance, and offers new directions for future research on NRM collaboration.

From the perspective of the human-land-sea giant system, terrestrial and marine environment, terrestrial and marine resources, terrestrial and marine disasters, as well as human socio-economic driving force, pressures and responses are included in the evaluation system of the ecological security of the terrestrial subsystem and the marine subsystem. Using an instrumental variable quantile model, structural equation model and system dynamics model, this study tested the mutual influence of land-sea ecological security in the GBA, as well as its underlying mechanism. The results are summarized as follows: 1) There is a clear non-linear mutualistic symbiosis relationship between the terrestrial subsystem and marine subsystem, while the marine subsystem is influenced by the terrestrial subsystem more significantly; 2) The increasingly scarce terrestrial resources of the GBA cannot provide strong support for turning the GBA into a world-class bay area; however, marine resources effectively offset the shortage of terrestrial resources, the needs of terrestrial socio-economic development provide a core driving force for the marine economy; 3) Ecological problems in the GBA are rooted in the land; the terrestrial socio-economic pressure has unidirectional negative influence on the marine ecology; the terrestrial environment is significantly inferior to the marine environment, and the negative influence on the fostering of terrestrial resources and marine environment is gradually emerging; 4) Marine ecological pressure is mainly rooted in the pollution discharge from terrestrial socio-economic development, but is scarcely related to marine economic development; 5) Owing to the differences in political systems, legal systems and cultural contexts between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the effectiveness of land-sea ecological governance is not yet significant. Hence, it is advisable to develop an efficient cross-border coordinated governance system, further deepen the land-sea integrated environmental governance, resource conservation, economic transformation and social response across the GBA, build a high-quality land and marine ecological community in accordance with higher standards.

Increased treatment could help alleviate water quality issues by constructing more treatment plants; however, in many areas there exist economic constraints. Energy recovery methods including the utilization of biogas and incineration of biosolids generated during the treatment process may help to alleviate treatment costs. This study explores the potential for investments in energy recovery from wastewater to increase treatment levels and thus improve surface water quality. This was done by examining the relationships between nutrient over-enrichment, wastewater treatment, and energy recovery at a global scale using system dynamics simulation as part of the ANEMI integrated assessment model. The results show that a significant amount of energy can be recovered from wastewater, which helps to alleviate some of the costs of treatment. It was found that wastewater treatment levels could be increased by 34%, helping to offset the higher nutrient loading from a growing population with access to improved sanitation. The production of renewable natural gas from biogas was found to have the potential to prolong the depletion of natural gas resources used to produce electricity and heat. It is recommended that agricultural nutrient discharges be better managed to help reduce nutrient over-enrichment on global scale.

In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.

Integrated aquaculture is better able to maintain a healthy environment and a balanced ecosystem for the cultured species as well as producing high quality commodities at a high yield. In this study, we demonstrate that ecosystem modeling can be used to help optimize and promote the integrated aquaculture model. First, the aquaculture management and main biochemical processes were parametrized according to the biological populations present, the physical environment, and the management practices for the integrated aquaculture marine pond of Portunus trituberculatus– Penaeus japonicus– Sinonovacula constricta. The ecosystem model of the pond unit was constructed by coupling the individual growth models of the three cultured animals. The goodness-of-fit indicators showed that this model accurately reproduced the dynamics of the cultured animals, plankton, and nutrients. After the ecosystem model was constructed and validated, the carrying capacity of the integrated aquaculture pond was evaluated by adjusting the stocking density and management practices based on the tailwater discharge standards. The economic benefits of the system and the ecological benefits of polyculture razor clams were quantitatively compared under two scenarios: the current stocking density and reaching the maximum capacity. The assessment results show that the aquaculture pond reached the carrying capacity when the stocking density was 1.8 times the current scenario (18 ind m−2, 27 ind m−2, 22 ind m−2 for P. trituberculatus, P. japonicus and S. constricta). At 1.8 times stocking density scenario, the profit increased by 51.59 %, and nitrogen and phosphorus removal increased by 51.48 % and 55.55 %, respectively. These results provide a theoretical basis for this integrated aquaculture model, which offers a promising way forward for sustainable industrial development. Possible applications and beneficial contributions of this aquaculture model in China are discussed.

In this research, a Copula-based optimization method is proposed to solve the problems in bivariate design of urban stormwater and drainage systems resulting from ignorance of precipitation temporal dependence and discrepancy between different design codes. Optimized design combinations of stormwater and drainage systems conditioned on given Kendall bivariate return periods or return periods of either system can be obtained using the optimization method for the case study of Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Results show that the temporal dependencies between precipitation series with different durations should be carefully considered, which can be sufficiently described by Copula functions. Based on the optimized design combinations, it is found that the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Sponge City Plans are underestimated for both Zhongshan and Zhuhai, which restricts the full use of the drainage systems. According to the optimized results, the planned return periods of stormwater systems in Zhongshan (Zhuhai) should be adjusted to 8.04 a (6.76 a) for the downtown area and 6.52 a (5.59 a) for other areas, conditioned on the planned return periods for P24 h in Sponge City Plans. The proposed optimization method provides a useful approach for the bivariate design of stormwater and drainage systems. The results of this research can give stakeholders references in compiling engineering plans for urban waterlogging prevention and help better balance the conflicts between waterlogging safety and economic efficiency.

The effective management of water resources requires the optimization of financial resources without forsaking social requirements. A number of mathematical models have been developed for this task; such models account for all components of the Urban Water Cycle (UWC) and their interactions. The wide range of models entails the need to understand their differences in an effort to identify their applicability, so academic, state, and private sectors can employ them for environmental, economic, and social ends. This article presents a description of the UWC and relevant components, a literature review of different models developed between 1990 and 2015, and an analysis of several case studies (applications). It was found that most applications are focused on new supply sources, mainly rainwater. In brief, this article provides an overview of each model’s use (primarily within academia) and potential use as a decision-making tool.

System dynamics approach is used to devise policy scenarios for the sustainable development of water resources in conformity with the temporal projections made for population growth. The projections made for water consumption and wastewater generation under the as usual baseline and modified scenarios for a typical district headquarter city in North India have shown that the water demand will enhance by 69% in 25 years if the current water supply practices are continued. Mitigation options proposed for curtailing the water demand and reducing the wastewater generation include progressive approach in succession for population stabilization, grey water reuse after treatment and combined scenario. The proposed modified policies would significantly reduce the water consumption pattern and should cope up with the demand of growing population.

Worldwide efforts to reduce emissions by creating a more efficient, carbon-free energy system may not be enough to stabilize the climate and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies, which remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, likely will be needed to meet global climate goals. The ocean, covering 70% of the Earth's surface, includes much of the global capacity for natural carbon sequestration; the ocean also holds great potential for uptake and longerterm sequestration of human-produced CO2.
 
This report builds on previous work from the National Academies to assess what is currently known about the benefits, risks, and potential for responsible scale-up of six specific ocean-based CDR strategies as identified by the sponsor, ClimateWorks Foundation. It describes the research needed to advance understanding of those approaches and address knowledge gaps. The resulting research agenda is meant to provide an improved and unbiased knowledge base for the public, stakeholders, and policymakers to make informed decisions on the next steps for ocean CDR, as part of a larger climate mitigation strategy; it is not meant to lock in or advocate for any particular approach.

The methodology on how ship emissions impact air quality and human health are comparatively well established and used in cost-benefit analysis of policy proposals. However, the knowledge base is not the same for impacts on the marine environment and a coherent environmental and socio-economic impact assessment of shipping has not yet been made. This risk policies to be biased towards air pollution whilst trading off impacts on the marine environment. The aim of the current study was to develop a comprehensive framework on how different pressures from shipping degrade marine ecosystems, air quality and human welfare. A secondary aim was to quantify the societal damage costs of shipping due to the degradation of human welfare in a Baltic Sea case study. By adding knowledge from marine ecotoxicology and life-cycle analysis to the existing knowledge from climate, air pollution and environmental economics we were able to establish a more comprehensive conceptual framework that allows for valuation of environmental impacts from shipping, but it still omits economic values for biological pollution, littering and underwater noise. The results for the Baltic Sea case showed the total annual damage costs of Baltic Sea shipping to be 2.9 billion €2010 (95% CI 2.0–3.9 billion €2010). The damage costs due to impacts on marine eutrophication (768 million €2010) and marine ecotoxicity (582 million €2010) were in the same range as the total damage costs associated with reduced air quality (816 million €2010) and climate change (737 million €2010). The framework and the results from the current study can be used in future socio-economic assessments of ship emissions to prioritize cost efficient measures. The framework can be used globally but the damage costs presented on the marine environment are restricted to emissions on the Baltic Sea and Kattegat region as they are based on willingness to pay studies conducted on citizens around the Baltic Sea where eutrophication and emissions of chemicals are particularly threats to the state of the Baltic Sea.

Plastic waste exposed to the environment creates problems and is of significant concern for all life forms. Plastic production and accumulation in the natural environment are occurring at an unprecedented rate due to indiscriminate use, inadequate recycling, and deposits in landfills. In 2019, the global production of plastic was at 370 million tons, with only 9% of it being recycled, 12% being incinerated, and the remaining left in the environment or landfills. The leakage of plastic wastes into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is occurring at an unprecedented rate. The management of plastic waste is a challenging problem for researchers, policymakers, citizens, and other stakeholders. Therefore, here, we summarize the current understanding and concerns of plastics pollution (microplastics or nanoplastics) on natural ecosystems. The overall goal of this review is to provide background assessment on the adverse effects of plastic pollution on natural ecosystems; interlink the management of plastic pollution with sustainable development goals; address the policy initiatives under transdisciplinary approaches through life cycle assessment, circular economy, and sustainability; identify the knowledge gaps; and provide current policy recommendations. Plastic waste management through community involvement and socio-economic inputs in different countries are presented and discussed. Plastic ban policies and public awareness are likely the major mitigation interventions. The need for life cycle assessment and circularity to assess the potential environmental impacts and resources used throughout a plastic product’s life span is emphasized. Innovations are needed to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover plastics and find eco-friendly replacements for plastics. Empowering and educating communities and citizens to act collectively to minimize plastic pollution and use alternative options for plastics must be promoted and enforced. Plastic pollution is a global concern that must be addressed collectively with the utmost priority.

The recent research on this contaminant threat is generally focused on surface waters (mainly oceans and rivers), while aquifer contamination is only marginally mentioned as an issue needing further investigation. Synthetic microfibers can be introduced into soils in different ways (e.g. wastewater treatment plants or greywater discharge, septic tank outflows, direct injection of contaminated water in cases of managed aquifer recharge, losing streams, etc.), and can thus reach aquifer systems due to leaching or infiltration in soil pores. Microfibers can then adsorb persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, which include persistent organic pollutants and metals, and become a carrier of harmful substances in the aquifer system, hence contributing to the overall contamination in both urban and rural areas. For this reason, it is of paramount importance, not only to assess the occurrence and fate of microplastic fibers in groundwater, but also to study the role of microplastics as carriers of contaminants within the aquifer and to advance standardization and organization of monitoring campaigns. Only by addressing these key challenges can hydrogeologists contribute to the state of the art on microplastic pollution and ensure that groundwater is not neglected in the environmental assessments tackling this contaminant of emerging concern.

In addition to this, waste management and environmental education and ocean literacy programs in schools are scarce, with islands suffering more seriously from these problems. Despite the amount of literature regarding causes and impacts of marine litter, there is still not enough research conducted concerning the public perceptions on both the problem and the potential solutions. This is even more noticeable in African developing countries, where resources and research are scarce. Perception plays a key role for ecosystem management and conservation policies. This study intends to explore the perceptions of local island fishing communities in Cape Verde regarding marine litter, in order to contribute for an improvement of marine ecosystem management and development of conservation policies. To achieve that, two participatory sessions were conducted in two communities in the island of Santiago—Porto Mosquito and Porto Gouveia—where brainstorming and active listening were used to create shared and authentic spaces for dialogue between the members of the community. Results show that the population of both communities were very aware of the marine litter problem. They were able to identify the lack of a proper waste management system in the island and the inappropriate behaviours of the population as the main causes of this problem. Equipment damages and the presence of plastic inside the fish were the most relevant impacts identified by the participants. These findings reinforce previous research on the importance of public engagement and environmental education to contribute to the conservation of marine ecosystems and to build a strong collaborative ocean governance.

This sort of assessment can evaluate the ability of a technology to meet IUWM objectives, such as reduction in mains water usage or return of surface flows to predevelopment conditions. An assessment of the water and contaminant balance for a new sub-division or existing urban area is vital in order to understand the complexities and inter-relationships between all water streams. The process allows greater understanding of potential alternatives and their impacts on the entire water cycle. The water balance should address all aspects of water flow in the urban area, both inputs (rainfall, subsurface flows and drinking water) and the outputs (evaporation, stormwater discharges, groundwater and wastewater flows) (Figure 6). A base case or “business as usual” calculation can be calculated to allow comparison of proposed alternatives to a standard development. The water and contaminant balance will provide information which can be used in assessing the overall sustainability of alternative water servicing approaches.

To integrate the concept of low-carbon and green development into the whole process of marine fishery development, it is necessary to comprehend the status quo and development trend of marine fishery carbon emission. This study measures the carbon emissions of marine fisheries in the Northern Marine Economic Circle, a development region representing China’s marine fisheries, from 2006 to 2019. We employed a system dynamics approach to establish a marine fisheries carbon emission dynamic model. In our model, five scenarios are set up to dynamically simulate the development and evolution trend of future marine fisheries carbon emissions, under the impact of rapid economic development, energy structure adjustment, and industrial structure adjustment. The results are as follows. (i) Total carbon emissions from marine fisheries in the northern marine economic zone show a year-on-year increase from 2006 to 2019. (ii) Simulations from the five scenarios indicate that rapid economic development significantly impact the increase of carbon emissions from marine fisheries, while adjustment of the energy and industrial structures helped control carbon emissions from marine fisheries. This study provides relevant information to control carbon emissions at the marine level, and predicts the development trend of carbon emissions from marine fisheries, which can provide a reference for fisheries to seek an effective path of energy conservation and emission reduction, and improve their high-quality development level.
